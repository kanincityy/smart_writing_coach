8CDBA4104C7E,"Identifying a career in high school helps students prepare for their future. In some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. Committing to a career as a young age it's a good idea.

First of all, identifying a career in high school help students to achieve their goals a little earlier. For example, if they start to study and be familiar with a specific career, they can graduate early. Meaning they might not have to spend 4 years in college, as everyone else. They can probably graduate from college after 1-2 years of studying for their particular career. Since they already going to have the knowledge from the courses of high school.

Another example is, students can start to take their future in a mature and serious way. For example, those courses can help motivate students about wanting to have a better future. Meaning they can change their thoughts about not wanting to study for a career. And that they're the ones responsible for their own things. It can teach them that having a career is that important thing that it's going to take them somwhere in life.

While some people think this is a good idea, some might not. Some people think that this is a waste of time. For example, students are going to have more things to worry about. Like studying more and passing extra classes. And this can cause for students to be mentally and physically tired. So they these people rather wait until college.

However, waiting until college can be a little late because students aren't going to have enough time to think about a partcular career they want. For example, once students are out to college, they need to have the career they're going to study for. And if they don't, they could pick one that they aren't really passionate about. Which causes more years in college, or them dropping out of college. And this can cause not having a great job, or future.

To conlcude, committing to a career as a young age is a good idea. It's a good thing for students to do it because it can help them to prepare for their future. Committing as a young age help them to achieve their goals a little earlier, which is amazing. It can help them to know what to expect when they go to college. Committing as a young age for a career can help students in so many ways, and these are examples in the ways it can help.

1928846BB272,"I believe that is good idea for the students to commit to a career at a young age. Instead, it is important for the students to find the specific career and graduate before time. In point of view, some students can choose, if they want to a specific career or more. In thesis statement, students can find the specific career because is great opportunity and good idea.

First reason, some students are considered to find the specific career. Because they want to enter to the college at their young age. For example, Generic_Name was prepare to enter to the college at her 17th years old and she win a scholarship, and enter to Generic_School to study her specific career. This shows that students can achieve their goals at their young age, that nothing is impossible.

Second reason, some students have to find the specific career. Because they want to prepare before graduate of high school. For example, Generic_Name had her classes pass and all the credits before 12th grade and she apply to the college to her specific career. Being students it's not easy to achieve this specific goal, but with work hard and perseverance all is possible.

Third reason, some students think that they can't commit to a career at a young age. Because they don't have courses to guide toward a specific career. For example, Generic_Name is in 12th grade and she wants to graduate before, but she don't pass her SOL and she have the enough credits for graduate. So this shows that students can't commit to a career. If they don't have everything that is necessarily to find the specific so they cannot achieve anything.

In conclusion, it is important for the students to find a specific career at a young age. However, it is a great idea to find the career that proponent to achieve before the time of graduate and get all that you need like: credits, grades,

exams, and courses. Also, this is a great opportunity if you want to be someone professional in this society. So be positive and perseverant.

EA42A6028804,"People argue whether or not its a good idea for students to study or identify a carrier of their choice when entering high school. I agree that students should commit to a career of choice when entering high school because they'll be ahead in life than many other students who dont get the opportunity to chose a career they want to learn in high school and studying their choice of career at a younger age would have them college ready.

Learning a specific carrier at the time when entering high school is very beneficial to students because it would have students who do chose to learn a carrier would have them very much ahead of students who their high school's dont even offer the opportunitie to learn a carrier during their years of high school. Learning and mastering a career of choice is something that students should take for granted because once mastered it can lead u to many opportunities while your in high school or have graduated. These opportunities can lead you to Paid internship programs, college scholarships, and even a Job right after high school.

Students who get to study a career of choice during their high school career would prepare them for college. Having students identify a career during there high school years would give them a better feel to go to college right after high school. Your resume would look much more achievable when colleges see you have earned a certificate for mastering a career you choose to learn during your time in high school. Learning something you want to do in the future would prepare you for college because it would almost be the same as attending a college, but without all the nice technology or lab equipment colleges or universities have.

Others would disagree when i say that students should identify a career of choice when entering high school and I understand why. While some parents would want there child to study a career earlier in life, other would recommend that they shouldnt be pressured in to choosing some sort of career when entering high school because it can be really stressful for the students to already having to chose a career to pick right after middle school and other parents want there kid to enjoy life as teenager and then worry about that later. The first reason I understand, but picking a career of choice is super beneficial to that student because studying it and then getting a certificate to when passed the class will lead you to many opportunities during your years in high school and would put you ahead of many others.

This is why I believe students should identify a career when entering high school. It puts them ahead of the game and prepares them for college and the future.

Technology at some point slow downs the physical growth or development of our body and it stops us from learning new things, But on the other hand it helps us to complete many task and save time. Modern technology has negative impact on peoples life.

People can check out books, shop, and play games without moving form place and talking to anyone. This leads to no physical activity, which slow downs physical development of our body. In fact, there was a survey taken few days ago and it states that more then 45% of middle schoolers in U.S.A has to take some kind of vitamin medicine as the dont eat their lunch properly because they watch t. v or phone while taking lunch, 38% middle schoolers have glasses because of sitting in front of TV or using phone all the time, and more than 46% students are overweight or underweight as they don't do much physical activities.

Secondly, technology stops us from learning new things. Technology helps people to complete new task in every day life, and then we get use to taking help from technology instead of trying it our self or learning it we get a habit of letting technology do our work. For example, if our mom not stopped us form spoon feeding then we would take it for granted and never learn how to eat our self.

But, On the other hand technology helps us to complete many task and save time. Technology helps us from not being delayed, it complete task 50% more faster than us, and helps us to save 25% of more time. For example, Our group got an assignment to do on Monday and the deadline to submit it was on Friday, So if i would read books to find some info, it would take me at least 2 weeks to complete that assignment, but thanks to modern technology,I was able to finish it in 3 days.

At last, I would like conclude that technology plays a major role in our day to day life. It has both type of impact negative and positive and it impact's on our life, but the main thing is ""how and when we use it"". Technology changes lifestyle of people and if we use it more it slow downs our physical growth and stop us from learning new thing, on the other it also completes our task easily and faster that us.

Im in 11th grade and when i'm older I want to be a certified mechanic and by that I am committed to this job because I want to follow my dad step. He used to work in this shop in El Salvador when he was 13 years old. Now he moved to USA in 2004 with my mom, he owns a shop with another guy in Alexandria, and the days I don't have school and Saturday I go to his shop and help him out. When I graduate high school I want to go to NOVA and get my certificate. I really enjoy working on car's and helping out others people if they can't get the car running or something. When I get older i'm going to own my own shop and i'm also going to have my cars that i'm going to build, and I think my parent would be very proud of me on what I have became, with everything that I make i'm going to help them get a house of a token of appreciation.

B9F6B348FC3A,"In my experience I don't disagree, that Emerson thing that mastered will never get him grow.

First reason, all people get mastered and that stop them to grow in something that they tried to do,For example if you are doing like your own job, and you are the manager you will see all the product that you are selling is going down, and you job it's not going well, of curse, you will be in unless to try sell other product and your stored that will happened to you and you stored that you will fell terrible and you will you not valuable to continue in you job because you are so tager to see that you job is going down not going up.

Second reason, Mastered is like you are in favor of something and your friend fight to tell you that you are round with what are you trying to do, After your friend try to tell you that you was so round you undated that you was round, them you tried to do the thing right but, you are you get in mastered and that make you to not have other change to tried again, everyone are unless to try something that they already mastered and, something for example you are teenager and you are is school and you did a test and you get bad scored of curse you feel so bad and you will no tried to retake your test again that having mastered .

Third reason, being scared to try again something that you love and that you thing if you try again that will be a same way that you did the first time, but went you try again, you will have more experience because you will try to not get the same mistake that you got first time, and will have to look so careful to not get the same mistake because you have more experiences. we all can do the thing many time the thing is that you have to believe in you,

and you will look that you will grow not matter how hart and, how many time you get upset, you have to be positive and to be screed if already have mastered.

Conclusion,It's that you never give up at what are tried, not matter how many time or change you take you feel that you get in mastered you always will have other change to start and trust that you can believe that you can do it because that's all that you need to start again.

I think students should wait until there last year or second to last year of high school, to think about getting a career. Students in high school should focus more on school rather than a career.

Do you think by the time students enter high school, They are expected to identify a career? I think that students who are about to enter high school.

The students with not pay attention to what the teacher, because they are so busy in their cellphones. Some students decide not to use it for educational purposes and uses it for other purposes. Using cellphones in class will also disturb other from learning, because they are so in to their cellphone. These are the reasons how using cellphones in class can effect them from learning.

First, you will not be able to learn if you are using your cellphone in the class. Using your cellphone in class may get you off task and u would not know what u learn today in class. Some days u would be mad and take it out on other, because of what you heard on your cellphone. Overtime your cellphone vibrate you always going to want to see what it is and that will have your attention. You will not be able to focus like you use to with our education and be on your cellphone at the same time.

Second, using your cellphone for other purposes can not help you learn what you need to learn. If you do not use your cellphone for educational purposes you would not know noting from school to know about. You can get in some problem for not using it for education. They should not have it out unless the teacher say you can for your assignment. This is why people should not use cellphones in school for these purposes.

Thirdly, people will disturb other people from trying to learn with there devices that can cause a disruption. The cellphones will ring and stop everyone from learning, because they will pay attention on whose phone is ringing. You will not be able to know how to do the work if do not know what to do. you are disturbing your classmates that are trying to learn the material they need so they can do something with there lives. You should not disturb your classmates from being successful in life.

As you can see, the effect of having a cellphone in class while you are trying to learn to be successful. You should not be ignoring what your teacher has to has to you and your classmates. The use of the cellular device can only be use for education and not other purposes.

0000C359D63E,"when a person has no experience on a job their is always going to be good people to help you and try to explane the job you need to get done in life you were not born with knowing everything. Life is bassicly about learing new things every single day even though without experience because life is simple and we must live happy and around with the people we love. When a person thinks they know everything in life they dont do good because they trying to make the other person less then others you must be kind to those the dont have experience because you may not know some day you will go to a different country. When you dont know anyting because you not from their so you going to need help from others to explain you about the culture or how to eat a food because you have to no experience on the new country. You must help a person the has no experience because maybe you may need help from the person the you didnt want to help.

yes, even thought you may not have experience in the type of job you seek,you can learn and teach others.

If you dont have experence in a restaurant for the job you seek for you will learn. For example a person the has no experence working in a restaurant,the only place they will offer you would be to be a diswasher. But you want to dream big because everytime a person has big dreams they can learn the job whereever, you want to be like a cooking person or a kitchen manager. In a job there is always going to be people the they dont want to see you in a better place because they may think you dont deserve to be there but you the only one the knows how hard you being working to achieve your dream .In life you always going to have proof without experience to see how good you are to learn a new job in the kitchen so if you can learn quick. They can give you a good place for you teach others the has no experience.

My dad has always talk with my cousins that when their is no experience you can always learn and fight for what you want. When my cosuin came to America he wanted to play travel soccer, he went to tryout but the coach told him the has any experience of talking english so he wouldn't make it. But later on he learn how to speak then, he went to tryout for fc virginia he made it also everyone was talking about him because hes a great soccer player also, hes a great person. Then he came to the house and thanks my dad because of the edvice he gave to him the even though you dont have experience,you can always learn and fight for you goals. My dad is man the wants the best for hes family because when he was a kid he wanted to be a loyer but it was hard for hes parents because they were really poor and the corruption was really bad in the country.

In every job their is always going to be a person with no experience. For example people with no experience those are the ones the learn the job and when they learn the job very well they always try not to make a mistake because thay want to get the job done with quality. Because everytime you do a job for someone else they want to see good quality on you before they give the kind of job they want you to get done for them. The people the has no experience in a job that doesnt make them a less person because we all are humans and we must have the same equal rights. we all know the everytime you aplied for a job the first thing they asked you is about if you have experience but its okay to say no because they can teach you and you can get it fast.

I think yes, you can be a good candidate to be hire without no experience because every person in the world needs to have a opportunity to try something new. People today in life they dont need to have experience to go find a job why because today in every work you get one week of train which people can learn the job just in one week. Because they will practice the job and every time they get practice they will going to get better and better. Practices makes everything better so dont be scared to applied for job only because it says you must have experience no just go believe in youself.

09A44D53EEAA,"It has come to my attention that first impression are almost impossible to change. Most of the people keep the same impression when they meet some one for first time or when they see someone after a while. Also, people keep the same impression when they are noticed about something that it going on and when they receive something new. Based on my experiences, I am completely agree with this statement and that the first impression are impossible to change.

One reason why I am agree with this statement is because I feel really happy when I receive something new that I probably wanted, or when I get noticed about good news. One example of my experiences is when I traveled to the United States and when I met my dad for first time after 17 years. I was really excited because I was about to meet my dad for first time, after I did not how he looked like. Also, because I always wanted to come to the United States and meet my step brothers, my uncles, my cousins, my aunts, and two sisters. I felt happy when I saw my family waiting for me at the airport, when I saw my dad with my three little step brothers. When I saw my dad I hugged him, I cried since it was my first time hugging and meeting him. Now I live with my family here and I am living in a country with many opportunities where I can make my dreams come true and be someone important for the society.

Another reason why I am agree with this statement is because when someone gets a gift, good news, clothes, or any other good things, he or she feels happy or excited about it and those are impressions which ones are hard to change. Another example of my experiences will be when my older sister gave my birthday gift last year, it was the IPhone I wanted to have. When I saw her holding a gift, I knew that it was for me since it was my birthday that day. When she gave me it I opened without waiting to much because I wanted to know what was it; when I saw the little apple icon on a box I got so excited since I knew it was a phone and also I was about to have the IPhone I really wanted. I felt thankful with her, I hugged her and I said thanks to her because she gave something that I was waiting to have. It is one expression I will not change, I still have it and I take good care of my phone.

A5328D4B32DA,"To me it is better to go to school instead of online classes because it is more involved. Personally I am a visual learner so being around peers and adults that can help me would be way better. If students were able to just stay home and do school they wouldnt have much resources and they wouldnt really learn the material. Students who are in class have to pay attention because adults are around and they have to listen to rules. If you are at home you could do anything and not learn the information just do it for the grade and not actually memorize it for later when you would need it.

Not only is it helpful academically attending school it also helps you socially. You learn how to interact with people and how they interact with you. In class if someone says the wrong answer it is explained and taught why it is wrong so you learn more and it helps you. You learn how to act with adults, how to talk to different people, see different cultures, learn right from wrong, just basic life skills people need. At home it is really just you doing work with maybe another person, you learn more academically but not socially and you need social skills too.

I think that student should participate in a school activity because if you normally have noting do after school but just setting around waiting for something to happen, but if you were in any of the school sports you be wont be bored all the time anymore. school can make you meet new friends or get even better at the sport than you are now. sport can make you keep in good shape and good health.

school clubs are really fun to do because you get to some really big project and activity but it also depends on what clubs you chose. like for example theres the FFA club , the FCCLA , the confetti club those club are really fun to do. you get to make new friends too if you waned to and when your in high school if you wanted to, you could run for school present for your school and make some changes to your school.

726D0B7A1677,"In many parts of the world people commit to a career when entering high school. There are many reasons for why this is awful, but will get into that. I argue that you do not need to commit during first year of high school. This essay will support this by looking at why it's excellent to commit during end of high school, or junior year Making sure you pick a career, and committing to it during end high school makes you grow as a person and makes you worthy.

Firstly, it must be recognized that you might not know your career by the time you enter high school. For instance people that come from middle school to high school are just little kids that don't know what they are doing,it takes time learn about a career. People should wait for senior year, and have a career plan because it's very significant now days because gives you much needed direction, and makes it clear that's where you see yourself in the future. For example if you are entering high school and you do not know your strength, weaknesses, and skills the career plan will help you in those areas. These examples clearly show why it's essential to wait, and have career plan.

In addition to this people can take plenty of different classes for careers in high school. Take these class as an example: business marketing,engineering class,and art. People change there career in high school, and might pick another career. Further more, it's ok to change your career because that's all what high school about exploring different careers. Thus, it must be concluded that it's never to postponed to change your major in high school, and there are internships that help you find a major. For instance internships are great experience for people many ways like decision making and about your future.

Another reason is students that are freshmen don't really need pick a career right way, it should be a process. Take this for example a NBA player James Brook, didn't know what he want to be after high school,

but when he was freshmen clueless about what he want it to be. When he junior year that's when he took basketball serious, and look at him to day having successful career. Just to show you that you don't need to commit to anything when are a freshman.

After analyzing the above, it can be concluded that I argue that commenting to career at young age is awful. It is for reasons why you should care about a career when you are a senior or junior. Over all don't worry about committing to a career when you are a freshman, not right to do.

I was so d and I was cried every day, but my mom told me that ""you will be fine, glow up and become strong then make him jealous"". So, realized that stay in sad mood everyday is not good for me, and I changed to think positive way and I focused more about myself, I did my makeup, I bought new cute clothes. And my ex boyfriends asked me to If you want mo to back together, but I said no because I knew he will hurts me again, but I was so happy that I could make his jealous and I told myself that I win then at the same time felt strong.

Third, you could have many supporters.

No one do not want to spend the time with negative person. If you have positive attitude people think about you that nice, and fun person so for example, your boss or your teachers and friends, they will support you and your life become grateful.

7B38A110CC94,"My grandmother used to say ""Your goals are not going to be done if you don't even move a finger"".

I am totally agree with what Thomas Jefferson wrote about how wonderful is how much we might done if we are always doing something. We can make plans for every goal in life, but it doesn't matter if we just have a plan because we have to work in that plan to get that goal done, we accomplish a lot things more when we are doing something, when we have that determination to get things done to feel proud of ourselves.

First of all we have to feel, we need purpose and strength to accomplish every goal in our life to feel proud in a future. For example, when I was little, my biggest dream was to be with my parents one more time as a family, we were separated at that time; I was in my home country, El Salvador and they here in the United States. I had that dream, but yes, it was just a dream. why? Because I was afraid of the journey to be with them again, they used to tell me ""If you don't do anything you will never know how different your life could be here with us, so throw that fear away and let's do something"". Then in my head I said ""if I don't get that courage to make the journey I will never going to see my parents again"" because I knew that they can't go back to my country, at the end I made that decision and I made it, I am with my parents again and as a gift I learned a new language, now I know i'll be more helpful for this country because I am bilingual now.

Furthermore, we can see in every aspect of life how persons that one day were a common citizen, now are really important in the society because they were always doing something, they were working on their goals. On the other hand we have as example my home country, El Salvador's new president,Nayib Bukele. He was just a citizen like others but he was tired, tired of the political corruption that my country was going through, so here is what he did; he made his plan, he worked on his plan, he worked and made things for the country. Then he became a mayor because people chooses him as their mayor because of all his honest job, he started running for president in 2015, he had a hard time trying to find a political party that supports him with his new ideas and purposes for the country but the parties rejected him because they said he was to young,also they knew he was honest and that he will not admit any corrupt job that affect the country, and they were always looking for reasons to reject him, but he did not give up.

Finally he made his own political party and he get the support of all the people that get tired of live in niggardliness during the governance of other parties, he fought against the two most powerful parties in our country, as a result he won the elections in 2019 and he became the new president of the nation.

Many people think that it doesn't matters if you have goals and make plans for your future if you don't have some resources as money or a good social status, they can also see life as a random game which means that if you accomplish something they will say that is just luck, however; what they call luck, other people call it, late nights of doing something for what you want for your life.

In other words if you want your life to be successful, you don't have to spend your time just dreaming about what you want, because things may be done only if you are always doing something which means; work for what you want, stop thinking about your life goals and start working on them, determine yourself never to be an idler.",Female,11,Hispanic/Latino,643,699,686,16,7,98.0,46.87782888,35.47925608,248,699,Independent,Not economically disadvantaged,Being busy,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.5,"my grandmother used to say ""your goals are not going to be done if you don't even move a finger"". i am totally agree with what thomas jefferson wrote about how wonderful is how much we might done if we are always doing something. we can make plans for every goal in life, but it doesn't matter if we just have a plan because we have to work in that plan to get that goal done, we accomplish a lot things more when we are doing something, when we have that determination to get things done to feel proud of ourselves. first of all we have to feel, we need purpose and strength to accomplish every goal in our life to feel proud in a future. for example, when i was little, my biggest dream was to be with my parents one more time as a family, we were separated at that time i was in my home country, el salvador and they here in the united states. i had that dream, but yes, it was just a dream. why? because i was afraid of the journey to be with them again, they used to tell me ""if you don't do anything you will never know how different your life could be here with us, so throw that fear away and let's do something"". then in my head i said ""if i don't get that courage to make the journey i will never going to see my parents again"" because i knew that they can't go back to my country, at the end i made that decision and i made it, i am with my parents again and as a gift i learned a new language, now i know i'll be more helpful for this country because i am bilingual now. furthermore, we can see in every aspect of life how persons that one day were a common citizen, now are really important in the society because they were always doing something, they were working on their goals. on the other hand we have as example my home country, el salvador's new president,nayib bukele. he was just a citizen like others but he was tired, tired of the political corruption that my country was going through, so here is what he did he made his plan, he worked on his plan, he worked and made things for the country. then he became a mayor because people chooses him as their mayor because of all his honest job, he started running for president in 2015, he had a hard time trying to find a political party that supports him with his new ideas and purposes for the country but the parties rejected him because they said he was to young,also they knew he was honest and that he will not admit any corrupt job that affect the country, and they were always looking for reasons to reject him, but he did not give up. finally he made his own political party and he get the support of all the people that get tired of live in niggardliness during the governance of other parties, he fought against the two most powerful parties in our country, as a result he won the elections in 2019 and he became the new president of the nation. many people think that it doesn't matters if you have goals and make plans for your future if you don't have some resources as money or a good social status, they can also see life as a random game which means that if you accomplish something they will say that is just luck, however what they call luck, other people call it, late nights of doing something for what you want for your life. in other words if you want your life to be successful, you don't have to spend your time just dreaming about what you want, because things may be done only if you are always doing something which means work for what you want, stop thinking about your life goals and start working on them, determine yourself never to be an idler.",6

Can imagination be more important than knowledge?

I think that imagination can be more important than knowledge. Due to the imagination of some scientists have created a massive number of inventions that benefit almost all the people of the world in that part is when knowledge is created based in imagination. In movies of sci-fi the director imagine a space full of flying cars and gas stations in the space, one great example was in the movie ""Return to the future 2"" the director and the writer of the movie imagine a skateboard that could elevate one ore two inches from the floor and they put it in the movie, and now scientist invented a skateboard that can elevate four centimeters from the floor.

First of all, whiteout imagination the world couldn't be the same like we know it right know,the imagination can help to improve your knowledge. Think about that a world whit geometrical forms like squares or rectangles, horrible! For example: Bill gates was a normal person, studying in a normal university, and whit a normal family. But one day he imagine how to improve his knowledge of school of the systems of computers, then he invented windows, so thats is a great example o how imagination can change the world.

Also, the imagination can help people work. You use it in projects, you use it in homework, also you use it in tests (Like me right now). For example: I was in a project of a debate of countries, my team was N.Korea, i needed to imagine if i where in Generic_City presenting my statement to all affiliated countries of UN, so i began to write, i though i was going to lose, because my enemy was the Westerns powers, but then we could win due i could imagine if the situation was like i where a person of N.Korea speaking to orders governments.

Third, imagination makes you feel better, when you are bored or when you are sad, the imagination always can make you appear a smile in your face. For example: i meet a partner that was depressed, i tell him ""i know how you are going to be happy, imagine you and the people you love to be near are in a vacation, then imagine you are whit out problems, whit out school, whit out homework,etc. Now i think now you are willing to be without stress or difficulties in these day"", he told me he was better.

9009B5C53A85,"Dear, Principal

My cousin when she eats food from the cafeteria at school, She feels less healthier and very bloated after eating school lunch. The school menu will change to a new and healthier school lunch .I think changing the school cafeteria menu is a really good idea.

Students can try new foods ;For example, i get really frightened to try something new because what if i don't end up liking it, i get very paranoid on trying new things especially food. However, I end up really liking the food and end up getting it more than once. Also, many students are tired of eating the same food every day and not getting any change. Cafeteria workers may be tired of making the same food everyday and may try something new for students to try. Some students get irritated and fustrated because students keep eating the same dish everyday and the school does not make any changes to the food.

Students will also have more appetite on the cafeteria food if it changes. Students will actually get food and not starve because some students starve because they dont like the food. Also, students won't leave school to go out and get food. When students go out and get food they sometimes don't make it on time or they eventually end up skipping and not going back to school, if the school menu changes and gets better and healthier students may not skip and stay in school and still be here and ready fortheir next class.

While some people believe that changing the school lunch menu is a good idea, others argue that changing the school menu is a bad idea because the change of the school menu can take away students favorite foods. Although this might be valid, there is several ideas to be considered, such as more healthier foods for students. If students eat more healthier students can be more active and not be tired in class and actually pay attention in class because students are not that tired. Students will also be more energized and focused on what students are doing in school. However, if students are eating more healthier students can pay attention and not miss a single lesson in school and not miss any work.

I think the school lunch menu change will change the way kids eat and also change the way staudents eat. Students will have more appetite in the school cafeteria. Also, students can try new food and see if they like it and are actually enjoying it. The school shoud change the school lunch menu because it will give students a great opportunity to try new food and also make them healthy and energized and in a good mood. It's a very good idea to change the lunch menu students need to try new foods and not let students eat the same food everyday.;However, the cafeteria workers can enjoy on making something new and make it with love.

07F3241EB3C6,""" How would pairing older students with younger students in school be helpful for both older and younger students?""

When I was in elementary school in Zambia I skipped 4th grade and went in 5th grade and it was challenging for me to keep up with the work in 5th grade. I was used to doing the same work as the other 4th graders in my school however things changed when I skipped 4th grade to 5th grade. When I got in 5th grade I started doing harder work than I did in 4th grade, I started getting lower grades than I did in 4th grade. When I was in 5th grade (where there were older people than me) I had to work hard to be at the same level as the other 5th graders. This was like taking college classes in high school. Pairing older students with younger students in school will help both the older and younger students because the younger students will be able to learn from the older students, the older students will learn how be good examples for the younger students, and the older students will encourage the younger students to keep learning and become good examples when they grow up.

When younger students are paired with older students, the younger students will be able to learn from the older students. Generally speaking kids are most likely to follow what older people are doing. In this case if older students are paired with younger students the younger students will learn good manners from the older students. Younger students will learn many things from the older students such as: good behavior, hard work, kindness, and etc... When I'm sitting around elder at home I learn a lot about different countries and cultures in the world. For instance, when the elders are talking about what is happening in Congo - a country in Africa - I learn about the economy in Congo and its government. It is just like learning in my Civics class at school. This is beneficial for me because I get learn and share about is going in some other places with my Civics teacher.

When older students are paired with younger student, the older students will learn how to be good examples for the younger students. Being a good example for younger kids is best for what the will do and be in the future hence, it is why my parents tell me to be the good example for my younger my younger brothers by being well behaved and respectful so that my younger bothers will learn from my behavior. My AVID teacher told me that when his son was young he taught him that boots were bananas and bananas were boots therefor his son knew that boot were bananas and bananas were boots. According to what AVID teacher told me in the pasted sentence it shows that kids do what elders do. It is really important for older people to be good examples for the younger ones.

When older students are paired with younger students, the older students will encourage the younger students to keep learn in school and become good examples when they grow up. Additionally when older students are paired with younger students it will encourage the your students to work hard and on the same level as the older students. I have a friend who skipped 7th grade at my school. When I asked her how she was doing in 8th grade, she said at first it was really hard for her to maintain her grades. But she encouraged herself to work hard and get good grades. She had to study every night and on the other hand she had work to do at home. It became challenging for her to keep up with both school work and work she did at home. Ultimately from all her hard work she got a scholarship for college while in middle school.

Pairing older kids with younger kids in school is helpful for both the older students and the younger students because the younger students will be able to learn from the older students, the older students will learn how to be good examples for the younger students, and the older students will encourage the younger students to keep learning in school and become good examples for others when they grow up. How would your life be like being in a place where there are no elderly people to learn from? We should always be good examples for younger people so that they can learn from us.

CDCE16D2C836,"Boom that's the sound of a volcano that just erupted. An enjoybale educational activity for me is a volcano because they are intresting and an excellent science expirement.

The first reason I like volcanoes as an eductaion activity is because they are intresting. I've always wandered what caused a volcano to explode. Now I don't need to because I know now what causes them to erupt so voliently. Valcanoes are very fascinating to watch erupt when you see the magma flowing down. The magma can be so hot it can be like being hit with a ray from the sun. It's very awesome how the volcanoes are fromed and made. But as cool as volcanoes are they can still be pretty dangerous,because they could cause harm and erupt,cause chaos. sometimes volcanoes erupt at random times. Sometimes in villages or islands and in this case people don't have time to run. Because the magma flowing down is like an avalanche because it goes really fast and the people can't outrun the magma because it is to fast. There have been more volcanic eruptions that have killed people even children. Like pompei which was a huge volcanic eruptionthat killed a lot of people. After the eruption paremedics and police went back to discover the remains of people under huge rocks. Volcanoes are very intresting althougj they can be dangerous at times it's amazing how it looks when it erupts. Volcanoes are one of the greates things to study.

Next a volcano would make agreat science project. A volcano is a good science fair project. Because it's very amusing to see how the volcano erupts. When it erupts you can see the hot flowig magma as if people on a raft were going down. Volcanoes are a good science roject because it lets you know more about volcanoes and how thy come to form. Volcanoes are very rare to find here where I live at but there are still some outhere. That's a good science project not only because they explode but because you can even show the layers. Volcanoes have layers the top the middle and the bottom. The top is where the magma shoots out like a bullet from a rail gun. The middle is the less calm part and the bottom is where all the magam is. That is why I think a volcano is a good science project.

2B69ADAD868C,"""some people may say that growth does not depend on doing something beyond what they have, for it is not unnecessary.'' However, that is a fallacy idea because we all know that is not true. Wise people believe that doing something beyond what they have will make them grow as a person, both physical and mentally. Unless people try to do something beyond what they have already mastered, they will never grow, because growth comes from doing something that someone has never done before, it comes from trying out new things, boost up our confidence and makes us progress.

Doing something beyond what we have already mastered, will make us try out new things that will help us move on further. trying new things is the only way we can know what we are capable of. for example, i remember trying out something new which was beyond the things i knew, i felt different and new. the feeling that i felt was growth. Trying is what makes us know who we are and what we are capable of.

If people do not do something beyond, how do you expect them to grow, when growth is defined as making progress in what someone does in his life time. growth is producing new things that has never been done before making someone realize how good it is to do some that is convince and improve in our skills. Not doing something beyond is as good as not growing. doing something beyond will boost up someones confidence in doing things. the ability to try new things beyond what we have already mastered is what we call self-esteem that alluded from confidence. How would someone have confidence when they do not try new things.

Thinking beyond the box , makes some people become dogmatic with affirmative thoughts, because they would always want to do something with diligent. how do can someone expect a person with fallacy ideas become dogmatic? For example, how can someone define a person who does the same thing over and over without changing? It becomes irritating and unpleasant. growth comes from the things that we do beyond what we have already mastered.

Some people might say, "" it is not necessary to do somethings beyond what you already have because, having excess of something is not good.""however, that is not right, we all know that having something in excess will always push us to doing more things. for example, Trevor Noah once said,'' nothing is enough not until you die from it,"" meaning nothing will never be too much. The more we try doing something beyond the more we intend to learn. we all learn from doing something that is beyond our imagination.

Unless we try to do something beyond what we have, we will never grow, because growth comes from doing something someone has never done, it boost our confidence, and makes us become dogmatic with positive thoughts. doing things beyond, will always produce good results at the end, such as, advancement, making progression in our daily life.

D5C7AA1266CC,"Yes teenagers should do curfews because they will stay out of trouble and stop braking the law. They will be discipline,and have respect of themselves and others example lets say you have a child is a minor and he or she breaks the laws and always gets in to trouble the military is one of things that will keep you discipline or otherwise they won't be well trained. The next thing I want to add is young people have to be shown and have experiences the a 10:pm weekend curfew is a descent amount of time to get them well trained other places like military, Juvenile, and like closing of businesses. Teenagers have a hard time staying in one place of a very long time with no free time a midnight curfew for teenagers is good for them so they can reflect and learn for their mistakes.

Some teenagers are committing crimes and getting away with it but this program well benefit them but in a matter time they will become good teenagers and obey the law. However, they will carry the behavior through their work place and public areas with good attitude and good behavior and it will never interfere of young person's live for example,lets say a job interview and the person who wants to hire you and he or she will see your characteristics and how many times you have broke the law and getting into trouble the person won't hire you can't get a job when you have a bad record of committing crimes and facing the law so, curfews are a good suggesting with young people that you can't say no to. However, another example is vandalizing when you harm someone's property without permission as an example like graffiti, braking car window's, and invading somebody else's property.

Generic_Name and Generic_Name were not Generic_Name said ""why not the national park its huge and beautiful"". After some talking and arguments everyone decided. We'll go to the most voted park first to the least since. State park had the most votes that was their first destination.

Have to go to the park she voted for the community park. A week later Generic_Name waking up up early and telling them to eat breakfast and get. Ready to go, 2 hours later everyone all ready for the. Community park wasen't really that far its about 20 minutes over there.

When they arrived wasent really alot activites like the state park but was a good place for a walk and another spot. To eat and take breaks,""alright so eat or start walking"" said Generic_Name. Everyone said walk first to see whats around and maybe play ball at a good spot. During the walk they came back to the spot where they can eat. Generic_Name said ""well i guess its time to eat then lets play a quick game of ball then we go home. They finished then decided to play a quick ten minutes of ball. As ten minutes go by they forget about the time and. Instead played for thirty minutes they all went back. To the car and on their way home on the. Way tho Generic_Name was telling everyone ""Guys next week finally time for the nation park""

Four days later everyone went to go buy 2 cameras because. If they loose 1 they Generic_Name will be holding the other one. Generic_Name will be holding the extra was expensive but they had to go with it.

Gone in shock he ran to the living room to see everyone saying ""good moring sleepy head"". Generic_Name quickly went to get his clothes ran to his closet to change and get ready. As he is finally done he ran saying ""are we all ready"" with joy everyone shouted ""YES"". Then they drove of to the final park of their month and ""hopefully"" said Generic_Name last one of the year.

When they arrived Generic_Name with almost anything thats a positive feeling. Soon turn to sad because he comepletly forgot his camera because he was in a rush getting ready.

44911FE6867D,"As a middle school student, I will tell elementary students to not do drugs,juul, or drink alcohol. The reason I'm telling them to not do this is because their lungs are going to get ruined,and they will not be able to breath good and they might need an oxygen tank. Also if they do it over and over again they will get addicted and probably they're going to do it for their whole life. Another reason to not do it is because if they might give it to one of their friends or tell them to try it and they might get addicted to it.

My second lesson to tell is to not get in trouble specially when you're about to get six broken pillars because the you're going to have to go to a meeting with your parents and all your teachers or sometimes just you and your teachers. Also if you do get the six broken pillars then you are going to have lunch detetention and not hang out with your friends at lunch and you will probably want to hang out with your friends and not just stay there and stay quiet for the whole lunch. Another rason you don't want to go is BIP why? you ask well BIP is a room where you go if you did something bad.

Third is don't do dumb stuff like get in trouble for running in the hallways,play fighting,or talking back to a teacher. All of the things I said are the dumbest reason to get in trouble for specially when you're on a rush to get to class or lunch. Other reasons to get in trouble is being tardy and if you're tardy you will get a broken pillar unless you have a note from a teacher or an excuse.

Fourth reason is to get involved in school activitys like basketball,track,soccer,volleyball,or whatever you play. It is good because it helps yoiur muscles be strong help you stay strong. Also try to keep your grades up and not bring them down because then you're not going to be able to participate in events specially in important events. One of the reason to not get in trouble is because if you do you'll probably get kicked out of the team.

In conclusion is better to not get in trouble because your parents might get mad and won't let you participate. Also try or get better grades so you can succeed in life like other people or one of your family members. You can also get a better job or get a better house,car. You can even have a better lifestyle.

For starters, it can help you achieve something or somewhere in his or hers life. Because, they or you can use your imagination to invent something that can benifit the world or daily sociaty problems. It also might have you even more suited for more major important jobs nowadays. For example, a doctor, a sergin, a engenire, and much more.

In addition, it is also veritile on doing it in many other ways. It can't just specificly just of types of sicence studies.

Their are people that don't like to be guide by others but they have a knowing in their life in what is good and bad by their experiences.

Violence can be make by a bad understanding. That's why people should seek guidance from experts and learn how to talk to each other. Usually if you are young , sometimes we don't know have to talk and their where problems came from. However

Community park provide a lot of opportunities such as spending time with friends and family, sports and exercising, and doing school assignments. These are my three reasons what you can do respectfully and peaceful at your nearest community park. I hope you find these helpful for you in the future.

Spending time with friends and family at a community park is a good way of making bonds stronger with each other. Parks have a lot of activities to do in a park for example there is a lot of outside games you can play. My opinion on how parks can make your bond stronger is that you can talk to them while you walk, jog and other activities. For example Generic_Name and Generic_Name went to the park to go play checkers. They talk about grades and other subjects for one hour. Their bonds got stronger they hang out every day.

Community parks have a lots space playing. Sports burns calorie's and it is very fun to play sports. You can make new friends with sports might even get ask to play on their team. For example Generic_Name brings her new ball to her community park nearest to her. Generic_Name brings her ball to the court kids dashing as fast they can to her. A crowd of kid show up to her begging if they can play they make teams. Generic_Name makes a lot of friend and plays soccer with them everyday.

Parks are good way to study and do school work because it is peaceful and natural sounds help you get relax.

Imagine nice sunny day no wind hear of birds and grass bending every direction. Studying in a park will help you a lot because you are not going to get interrupted my neighbors and relatives. People from the park might help you and give you way and strategies to get a good grade on a test. For example Generic_Name want to pass his test. his sibling are loud he can't focus. Generic_Name goes to the community park to study for the big test.

7797541CF0A6,"The succes is what people really want all the time, but it is not easy at all. Sometimes we have to pass throught dificults situationt to get to the sucess. Each person want to be succesful in life, but to get what we really want, we have to be positive with the head up. We dont have to put ourselves in an unconfortable situation because it won't help us to get the succes that we want. It just going to help us to go through the way of failure. Not all the time going to be easy. We must have to fail a lot of time, it help us to see what we are doing wrong, and what we have to change to get what we want. We just have to keep going with enthusiasm and believe in ourselves. The sucess help to the people to be someone in life.

We can see in our everyday how hard is life, and how we have to strive ourselves to get the sucess, but we can see that there are obstacles and we have to know how to pass through it. Life is hard, but nothing is imposible if we have already planned what we want. Sometimes we dont get the result on what we have been worked. But nothing can be hard at all, we have to know that all is posible, we dont have to take it as imposible. One example that we can see in our everday are the students in the university. Not all of them have the support of the family to cover the cost to pay the the clas in the university. Some of them have to work to get the money and pay their study. Some of them have to fail because it's not easy to do at lot of things at the same time, but we can see that they keep going through it, doesn't matter what. To get the sucess we have to work and just focuss on what we want. At the end we can see the result. We must have to fail a lot of time, but we have to have in mind that we can do it. The people who graduate, at the end they remember how hard it was. But they believed in theirselves and also keeped their head up with enthusiasm, and learned of each mistake that they had done in the way to the sucess.

Other example can be the student from other country in high school, at the end of each year the student have to do a test of each subjet they have. But is not easy fo them because not all of them speak english, they have to learn a lot and out themselves in a hard situation to do it. They have to effort a lot themselves, some of them have to fail like three time to pass the test. But they know that nothing is imposible if they believe in themselves. They know that they have to take tests to graduate, we can see the hispanic student in Generic_School, they have to take the ESOL test each year but they have to study a lot because their first language that they know is spanish, and they just have been in this country in a little while. For some of them the situation is hard, but at the end we can see them in their way to graduate and how proud they are of themselves because it's not easy to learn english.

Also, we can see the organizations that want to help to the people who doesn't have nothing, they have to do a lot of thing and have to be prepare because no one know if they gonna get what they want. The goverment and other institutions have to aprove the organization and one of the best examples is Shakira and her fundation ''Pies Descalso"", she wants to help to the children with the eduation, and alimentation. She had to do a concert to get the money to start with her fundation, she has been in hard situation but she always believed in herself. We can see today how she had changed the life of millions of children around the world, how bennefitted with education and alimentation they are. child from poor families are now someone in life, some of them are in the university. All can be hard but never imposible. She accomplish her dream, doesn't matter what. In her way, were obstacle and difficults things. But she didn't give up because of that.

People have to know that doesn't matter what they can achive what they really want and keep going in their way to the sucess. Nothing in life going to be easy but they have to know that dreams can come true. They must have to fail a lot of time in the persuit of sucess. But they have to know that nothing going to be in the way they want but they can keep going until they can achive their purpose.

DA8F8C0D6952,"I believe that students attending school from home will benefit for many different reasons. Students who experience anxiety attacks, depression, bullying, or just not being able to attend school for the day will find great use in online school, they can connect with their classes or teachers without being in school and not have to miss out on important information or work. Students are able to be in a safe environment at home if they do not feel comfortable in school.

Furthermore, students with anxiety or depression may have a harder time going through out the school day then their peers. For example, my girlfriend who has very often panic attacks, dislikes attending her current school. She was a new transfer student to the school and was also new to the school itself. She found it hard to not have anybody to go to and vent during the school day which causes her to stress and have anxiety. Moreover, she gets very often panic attacks during the day which makes her not want to come to school more often. She finds it easier and safer to stay at home. When ever we're on the phone over face time, she's always doing her class work that she takes home to complete. She's a hardworking student and always does her work but because of the environment she's in, it limits her on what she is capable of.

Not only that it would help students feel secure, but for the students who are sick for the day and cannot attend school, wouldn't have to miss out on important information or work. For example; there are days where I just feel weak and tired but I wouldn't want to miss a review day for a major test the next class. If there was online school, I would be able to connect with my teacher and the classes from home where I feel comfortable. Also, my mom wouldn't have to worry that i'm failing my classes because i'm not showing up to them. I believe that other students would agree with me on this argument because almost everyone I know, wishes they could attend school from home.

Moreover, adults might not have knowledge of this, but let me tell you; there is a lot of drama and rumors in every high school. No matter where it is, the policies it has, the advances of the students, there is drama. And drama is one major factor on why students wishes to attend school at home. Just Imagine the advances of our present civilization if there was no drama at school, and no have you heard this or have you heard that. Drama and rumors are big time distractions to daily school work and it peaks the interest of every student. By enabling online school, students dedicated to become scholars are able to take this distraction out of their equation. They can attend school without dealing with the big mouths talking up and down and all around the school.

3954DF9C83CD,"Do you think high school should be three years or four years? should students go to college with three years? how do students get enough credit for three years? why do people go to summer school or night school? I say taking high school for three years is not a good idea Some peolpe say that it help if you take four years rather than three.

The first time i went to high school i knew that i wanted to graudate in fours years so i can have alot of time by my side to get everything done, because i knew that if i failed a class then i had to retake it again. So i wanted to have enough time to make up any classes or SOL that i have taken, so i can graudate on time with my friend and classmates. It's really stressful when you think about it beacuse you know that if you mess up you either don't pass or you don't graudate on time which kind of bad,it's makes you fee like you have a goal to make when you enter high school to pass all classes/ SOL then graudate on time.

People take the advantage to go to summer school and night classes to have the credits they need. When I was a sphomore i had to take summer school for algbrea,it was much better to take summer classes beacuse you really didn't have worried about the credit or how many classes you have during regular school. You just had to focus in one class, to me like it beacuse we had one class to focus on it made it feel a little stress free. I

had freinds who had to take night classes, they told me that taking night classes were the same as taking summer school but the only differences one is during the summer. It's nice to take summer school and nights classes because you have enough time to pass the class and get the credit, plus it give you more time to have all of the fun classes to take when you have all of the credits.

Taking fours years in high school gives you the opportunity to experiances the high school life, for instances you have all the school sprit. I'm talking about the football games, the pep-rallys, homecoming, and prom. you get to experiences that, it's the best feeling beacuse you know when you are a senior in high school you will always be part of your your school's familes no matter what. After high school you don't get to live the high school experiences anymore you have to become an adult.

Most people say that having three years is better than fours years because it is much faster rather than taking four years beacuse how slow it will take. But honestly it always going to feel fast weather you are taking four years. But in the futrue i hope that some high schoolers will choose to stay all four years just for the experiences of living like a high schooler and what it feels to have that one last chances of being a kid before you go out into the real world.

For exmple, whne you famliy, they always make new food sometimes they teach the younger one too and that is leaning. Most of the time, learning at home helps you in the future a lot.

Another way long break is important is that, everyone needs to go traveling when they have the mean to. and whenever you travel, you see new thing and leann about them. You explode a lot things that like might catch your eye that you like and wanna be. That's deffinfly is learning. So I think we should get long break because after 10 mounths of going to school, we at least need to mounths to rest our brian. while we are out of school, we are always leaning because there are so many things in the some that we haven't been.

People who valus self-reiance defin it as the need for each individual to follow his or her own instincts and ideas. should they seenk guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matter? Take a position on this issue. support your response with reasons and specific examples.

First people who value stuff,cloth,shoes,phone and more. another thing that people value things is there family friend. Then they also value there house money. Everyone value something different. Some people have different cast. Everyone has to do different things in there self. If she had a pair of shoes that she had that are value $100 then she is going to value you because she would want to know,she would get mad or upset that her shoes get dirty or if there shoes get mess.

If the girl bought a pair of shoes for $100 she would be very upset because some girls don't ways there money on

$100 dollars pairs of shoes. If a guy bought appear of Nike,FIA,Adidas,Jordan,KD or something the guys will get made if there shoes cost more then $300 dollars and it got ruined. The guys hate when people mess around with there shoes and they ruin it. They don't like stepping in mud and they don't doing outside work.

If the guys are going to do outside work they should of bought in less expanse shoes not high price shoes. If they are going to work they should of boughting less expanve shoes like $20-50 not more then that so we could do alot of differnt things. Some people need to know about that shouldn't buy high price stuff they have to buy less its better if they do not buy high price shoes because they can work and bein looking at there shoes everysingle time and saying don't get my shoes dirty.

When teenage kids start work there like some I don't want to work but they should work becuse some teenger are like i want this no i this these expanve shoes. They are really exsenve stuff that alot of teenger want and like some just like to do differnt thing bought things they should not buy. Kids need to work so they now how much thing are because if are just asking and asking for stuff thats not going to work out wall there going to asking for really expance things that would not like.

Everyone needs to know how much things are and work for it and not ask because that is how they are going to value something. If they buy it with there money they will know and how they need too take care of it and not buy high price stuff. They more that kids start working and not asking there parent it would be better because the kids would be done.

I am working and i like to save my money because i can buy stuff that i need or anything but if someone buys me something i am going to value it becasue they took there time to come and bought something for me. like i did i bought my friend some pair of airpod and i bought my self some pair but when i gave it to him i said here is the pair of airpods that i got you for chrismas i wish you the best. It was better if bought him the pairs of airpods and not someone eles.

While many are discouraging by going into failure to failure but never give up, stay happy keep working hard and you'll find success. I'm firmly agree to Churchill words, no matter what, you have to keep the enthusiasm and keep working hard to get success. There is a lot of difficult parts in the life for example I was a clearly example of this because I went to failure to get success. When I was in 10 grade I take for the first time the Geometry Test, I was so nervous because I was going to take one of most difficult exams that I have never take it and yes I fail and then I take it 3 more times and I fail again. After 3 times of failure I take some minutes to think about it. And I say what is the best thing that I can do, Well the best way is preparing my self to take the test again. Finally after 4 times I pass it, and this situation give a big lesson never,

never loss the enthusiasm never give up, failure make me learn new things that will help me to improve and be success. One of my reason for this should be that

I have to had the Geometry test to be available to graduate that was the reason that motivate my self to pass the test.

Another difficult part of my life was when I move to this country, it was very painful because I leave all my family in my old country and all my friends that I know from my infancy, but that is not the very difficult part. when I move to this country I never though that the language would be a problem but i was wrong. It's very hard when see someone talking to you but you can't understand, it's feels pretty bad. Then I start to study English to improve my pronunciation and understand better, but like I say before I never give up I keep working and I will find success. My reason for this is that I want to a better future and I know that if I speak two languages I will have a better future.

CEFC32741811,"People who have self-reliance define it as the need for each individual to follow his or her own instincts and ideas. I think that getting guidance from experts could help make decisions better because most people look and ask for guidance on a lot of things most of them are on decisions to make whether it's a good or bad decision to make.

I have asked people for guidance on decisions i remember i asked my old teacher if i should move to the U.S or stay in my country Generic_City. He told me that it would be better to move to the U.S because i would have more chances of being successful over there than staying in Generic_City and that i would have a better life too and that was one of the hardest decisions i have ever made in my life because i was leaving friends and family behind and i didn't want that to happen.

I have been asked for help before, my friend one day she called me and asked me to help her on her relationship i could tell that she needed help and guidance i could her it in her voice they got into this argument and she told me that it wasn't the first time they have argued before and she told me that it got to this one point that it made her cry so i told her that she needs to break up with him and that he wasn't good for her and if she keeps dating him the argument's could get worse what if he starts getting violent with her and stuff. I told her that it's going to be hard but it's for the best.

People ask for help when they need it or when they want it , However some people may not agree with me because they value their self-reliance and trust their instincts, they think that they should keep their personal problems to themselves but eventually those people are going to start having this feeling like they should talk about it to somebody and ask for their guidance because the same thing happened to me i didn't like telling people what was going on with my life later on i started feeling like i needed to talk to somebody about my decisions and i started to ask my family and friends for guidance.

5AEF9C6DD861,"Is setting a good example by your own behavior the best way to influence other people?. People said, that setting a good example by your own behavior is the only way to influence others. A good attitude and behavior can influence others in different situations. It can influence people at sports and school.

Good attitude can influence others in different situations. One example of a good attitude in a different situation would be sports. For example, a football team has a game with a different school football team, and one of the teams loose the game, obviously the team that loose the game will be sad and angry, but if one person of that team has a good attitude that will influence the other team members because that person with a good attitude, will know how to loose and how to win, and he will talk with the football team members about that, it does not matter if you loose or win, there will be always different situations where you will have to accept that you loose or you will have to accept that you win, and you should be always with a good attitude. So, the team members will see that if you have a good attitude they will accept that they loose.

Another situation where your attitude and behavior can influence others is in school. School is one of the most common situations where your behavior and attitude can influence others. For example. if you wake up every single day with bad attitude and behavior to go to school that will affect you in your grades because a bad attitude causes laziness. If you see another student that is not lazy, have good grades and always is helping others, that is because of his attitude. If you have a good attitude in school that will influence others because they will see that with a good attitude and behavior in your classes you will be doing good in your classes, and you will be able to help others and teach them that if they fell bad or their grades are bad is because if their bad attitudes and behaviors . If students see that you have great attitude they will have a great attitude too because they will see that having a good attitude will influence them to be a great person in school.

In conclusion a good attitude and behavior is the key for you to be a better person. If people see that you are a happy, successful and a great person they will know that is because of their attitudes and they will fell influenced for you and they will have a good attitude in order to be successful and a great person.

3CDCFB2C7F25,"I believe that doing nothing is accomplishing nothing, it gets you nowhere. Being active, and having a purpose are essential in being successful, also always doing something is better then doing nothing.

To start off, being active can mean that you're accomplishing or trying to accomplish what you're doing. For example a boss of a company will always be trying to keep his business from loosing money, for he can't cant loose the company, so the boss will work towards saving the company.

Secondly, having purpose in life, or a goal is better then dreaming about it; for instance, if you ask a successful person how they got to where they are, they won't say I dreamed for it, they'll say I worked towards my goals and didn't give, even if they thought they were gonna fail.

Finally, always doing something is better then doing nothing. For example, if a student goes to school just to sit around and do nothing, he or she are wasting a opportunity to learn, and get an education towards what they want in life.

Some people might say, what if you fail pressing a goal; for instance, someone is trying to make money, or getting a job and keeps failing, they learn from the mistakes and keep the right mind set, if someone can do all that they'll flourish in the future.

The invention of technology made everyday lives a lot easier for a lot of people. People who love reading books can easily check out books online and do not have to go visit the library. Technology made it easier for people to shop; now a person can shop online for all the materials or supply that are needed for everyday use. In addition to that, technology can be use for reminding people about plans and events.

By using technology people can save a lot of resources that we use in daily basis. Technology made it possible for people to read online and that would decrease the supply of paper copy books. Driving from one destination to another just to get some food can cause a decrease on a person car fuel, but technology made it possible for the food to be deliver. Using technology can save a lot of paper that we use for school and work.

Technology made communication a lot easier for people who are in far away places. People who are in out of reach can communicate using Face Time. Using Email to to send a message to a friends that are far away is another way technology helps people communicate from long distance. People also use technology to call or text friends or family members that cannot be reach.

FE60E597467E,"What is positive attitude? Positive attitude is when a person has positive thoughts about something that went wrong or good, but they see all the possibles ways to success in life. Having a positive attitude is essential in lifestyle, this can bring happiness to your life, and can take you to extraordinary places. I think having a positive attitude is important because this is a way to express yourself around others, and to show the way you can manage your thoughts. I agree that having positive attitude is the key to success in life, and that everyone should have a positive attitude not just for a work area but anywhere.

There are many reasons to have a positive attitude, for example: you may want to have a positive attitude when you get a bad grade on the test, because you can think positive and say: "" I did bad on this test today but, I am going to keep trying and studying hard every time so I can do better"".

Another example is when you are doing a sport and you think you can't do it and that you are going to give up, you can tell yourself you can do it and have a positive attitude towards it. There are always problems in the daily life, and people deal with this problems not always with a good attitude.

What will happen if you don't have a positive attitude? Well if you don't have a positive attitude, you won't have success in life because you are going to have negativity in your mind and the word ""fail"" is going to become one of your favorites. Having a positive attitude is not always easy, and not all people have it. A negative attitude is the opposite of a positive attitude, and this can affect your life. For example: In school if you have a bad attitude things can go bad, when you are always being negative usually your problems don't get fix and you struggle more with your thoughts. This can mentally affect you, and teenagers are challenged every day by this issue.

The key is positively to a succesful life. I personally consider myself as a postive person. I try to solve every problem with a positive attitude because when I do so, my problems get fix the good way and I am happy with the results. If I don't have a postive attitude, all my goals would be nothing, I get stress and change my attitude, and I even hurt people's feelings without knowing. Success is important too because by this you can be a better person for society, people can judge you differently and you can help others when they are going through a lot. Positively is also mental strength,

it expands your knowledge, it changes the way you think about everything, and makes your life easier.

In conclusion, having positive attitude helps you to have success in life. Sometimes it's hard to understand how people can be so positive about everything, but not all people are happy in their lifes. Some people have their reasons to not be positive, and it's important to understand these people. Other people, like me, have postitive attitude towards anything, which is good because it helps you in your daily life, work, school and others activities. A lot of people like other people with a positive attitude, because it brings positive energy and hapiness to other people's life.

When taking courses in high school is more helpful because having a head start at a young age will open the mind of young students that has a specific career they are aiming for. This would let them know what they working towards, some may say that identifying a specific career in high schools is to early, but high school is meant to prepare students for college. In high school you take subject of what is required to graduate why can't you take classes that would help you get the taste of the career you are aiming for?.

When kids are growing up and when their parents ask them ""What do you want to be when you grow up?"". They always have big dreams: such as becoming an Astronaut, Doctor, or a Teacher. but they do not know what it takes until they start college, that should not be so, why do they have to wait till that period of time in order to know if this career is for them or not. High school is were it needs to start at, why start later when the future is here today?

Most college student change their major when they enter college that's mostly because they were not ready or prepared for the classes. This can be prevented, by allowing students to take courses, that will be helpful to them in the future.

For an example if a students was undecided about if they would want to pursue a career of being a Political science major or become a Nurse, that student would take a one Political science class and another of one Nursing class. This would help the student figure which career path is best for them.

8D59FC8F6696,"I strongly disagree with the school board they shouldn't add any more time to schools then we already have. Adding more time to schools could lead to many bad results. Bad results like students stop attending school, create a bad environment in the school, or even fry our brains.

Primary detail, students could stop coming to school. Most students don't like coming to school already because they say school time is just way to long. Adding more time could lead to many students trying to avoid this extra time. By staying at home getting more sleep time making them tardy for school. Some students like to start working at young ages and that means they need to be out of school as quick as possible. But if one and a half hour is added to the school time it could just stop them from getting into work on time. The more time we spend at school the more hours of valuable work time they lose.

Secondary detail, extra time at school would make a bad environment for all of the students. We may all look like we come to school to learn what we need for a better living when we get older. But not all of the students come to school for what they should some students just come for social time with friends. If more time was added to the school that would mean they would have more time to socialize with all their friends. Every school has a hand full of trouble makers and the more time they get to spend at school the more time they are likely to cause more trouble then they already make in regular school time. Most students who already dont like school would probably protest against their school.

Final detail, all the extra time working could end up frying our brains. I as a student sometimes get really tiered by my second class. Because sometimes we do things that need a lot of thinking specially in math class. The more time in our classes would mean more mental usage that could make us frustrated easily. When students start to frustrate they also start to lose their focus on things they need to do. Which would also affect our academics because we are so frustrated that we cant even think anymore.

In conclusion the time we have to spend at school is already more then enough. Although some people may say that more school time could benefit I say it really doesn't.

3FE7AF072783,"Soccer has always been the most important priority in my life. It is not just a game but a whole different world for of its own. In the other hand, education has been also an essential part of my life. Living in a world full of competitions and challenges needs so much of a person's will power and hard work then just having an outstanding goal and not working on it. Business is something devastatingly related to education and hard work but sports are also a type of business that most of the people do not observe it.

Lionel Messi, the greatest soccer player of all time, is the person I mostly want to meet. I have always been fascinated by your skills and finishing in the field. Every teenager changes their goals for their future at least 5 times, but I have had this dream of being the greatest soccer player in the world since my first year in middle school. I can assure Messi that if he takes me to the Barcelona's beautiful stadium, I will do my best to show him how serious I am to be the greatest soccer player. I believe Messi can select me to show the true feeling of being the greatest soccer player and to let me see the most beautiful stadium of their team because soccer has always been the top priority in my life, it is not just a game but a whole different, beautiful, and unbelievable world for me, and soccer is the only game that I can play all my life without any regrets.

It was the first year in middle school that I actually understood what soccer is. Since then I have been in love with soccer. I lived in Generic_City and my parents are Asian; that is why I have had quiet some obstacles during my life because any Asian parent wants their child to study, study, and study. I was always against those who thought that sports cannot be a true career and business. I never gave up; although my parents told me hundreds of times to work on your education and study hard, but I kept it all balanced and I didn't let my parents know that soccer was always the top priority in my life. Soccer teams and opportunities in our school is important, like working hard and getting into JV was really important for me, and I will surely work hard and do my best next year to get into varsity too.

Some people believe that soccer is just a simple game which anyone can play when they have free time and have nothing to do. I totally disagree with that concept. I believe soccer has its own world. It can be a professional career and it can be a brilliant way to earn money for those who works to earn money. The first day I watched Messi's video on YouTube had me surprised that how can a person be so magnificent at controlling, dribbling, passing, and shooting. He was just perfect. There are hundreds of soccer players out there who have unbelievable and outstanding skills like: Cristiano Ronaldo, Paul Pogba, Neymar Jr, Mbappe and so many more.

Did it ever happen to you that you have played for hours and hours and your mom calls you to come home saying, ""it is enough"", but you feel like you had just started playing 10 minutes ago and how did the time went so fast? It is always the feeling I have when I play soccer. I never get tired mentally while I do get tired physically after 3 hours of playing. I want to play more and more and that feeling never gets old. That feeling shows how much you love the action you are doing. Money is one of the most crucial thing to survive in this world but if I had to choose between never ending amount of money in my bank account and freedom to play as much soccer as possible, I would gladly choose soccer.

Most of the time my imaginations are so nice that I just do not want to move and ruin it because all I imagine is me playing in professional soccer game and millions of people being my fan and I have all the skills that I wanted to have. Imaginations are nice but in real world we have to work real hard and with passion to achieve our goals. Although most of the people believe that soccer must stay as a game that anybody can play in their free time, but I completely disagree because soccer is a complete professional career for anyone who wants to play.

9B3C82FCAE6A,"The place I would like to visit is Mexico because I love the type of food , to see my family , and the style at Mexico. Mexico is where most of my family came from . The food at Mexico is where my mom learn to cook and make different type of things she had to do for making the food . Not all my family is here with me at the U.S because they mostly all live in Mexico . The style there is great because we all really have this different type of style , where we can show people our style .

When my mom was ten years old , her mother teach her how to cook . Since that day my mom started making here own food for herself when her mother wasn't home and she didn't have a dad to cook for her so she just teach herself. So I would want to see how and what my mom used to make all of her good food she makes. To see the different ways that Mexicans do it than Americans . And I would want to try make food there with the things my mom used when she was a little girl . My mom told me that I was lucky to be here because the things we have to cook they didn't have in Mexico . The they had to make the fire to cook up the food . Sure my mom , mother could've have buy a oven be she didnt have enough money .

The second reason I would want to go to Mexico is to visit family . Most of my family doesn't live in the U.S . My gramother lives in Mexico , I've have never met her in my life. I met my grandfather when I was six years old and I haven't seen him since then . I have lots of cousins , aunts , and aunts in Mexico that I haven't even met. My family is the most important thing to me. They would always look out for me like I would for them. My family in Mexico helps my family here in the U.S , like with money . And I would like to go to Mexico and see them then tell them "" Thank you for everything you have done for my family "" . I would want to see how big my cousins are because I haven't seen them since I was little . And also meet new family members that I haven't met or just came into the family .

Since I was born here , in the U.S , as a city girl I have different type of style than my parents had when they was my age. I want to go see all the clothes they had or to wear for school . Schools in Mexico don't let you wear what you want. You have to wear the clothes they tell you to . So I would want to go and see how my mom had to dress and what other clothes she would wear for outside of school . My mom told me that she mostly wear n skits a lot because it was hot and for her school clothes. She said that when she was in Mexico she didn't even know what pants was for girls . My dad told me he lived in a different part of Mexico wear he could wear what he wanted for school and outside of school . But I would like to see how my mom dressed when she would go to school .

Wouldn't you like to visit Mexico ? I think its a good place to go list . Even if you don't have family that live there you can still see the different style they have and try different type of food there . Or you could go with a friend that knows a lot about Mexico and see what they do and what their family did when they was young . There is a lot of things you could do in Mexico .

EB0F373C1D2A,"Summer breaks in most countries are 45-60 days long. Students mostly enjoy the summer by going to a vacation or doing fun stuff. From students' point of view, 60 day summer break is the last thing they want to lose. However, most student lose track of their studies after spending such a long break away from school.

Furthermore, being 60 days away from your frisbee practice would massively impact your game; and the same applies to to studying, you will forget most of the lessons that you've learned. One might say, ""well there are summer classes to keep students connected with their studies."" But to be absolutely honest, no one wants to go to school in a hot summer day. We all want to lay low and have a cold drink in beach while listening to the satisifying sound of waves.

What is the solution? Put an end to long summer breaks (not completely removing them), and instead give students a week off after every 4 week of studying. It gives students and the faculty a brief break after every 4 week, and also it gives students time to work on their important projects. For instance, if I'm studying History of US Museums, I can get a chance to explore the museums and write an article of my own observation about museums in my area. Student can't get everything done on weekends so they need more time. Teachers on the other hand can keep track of the students during the 7-day break and ask them for their progression. Moreover, this gives students to participate in community services and/or religious services, which in my opinion, are crucial in building one's character. The summer break, however, is still there but shrinked to 2 weeks, giving students a chance to go on vacations and trips but not for long.

Your principal has decided that all students must participate in a least one extracurricular activity. For example, students could participate in sports,work on the yearbook, or serve on the student council.

Would Students want to be forced into taking a program, club, or after school activity, no, of course not. Nobody wants to be forced into doing anything in life. Besides if a student was forced to participate in an program what activity's would they have. what if he/she doesn't like sports or working on the year book or etc. How does it benefit the student in any way.

Students should have a right to decide whether or not they want to join a club or activity. The reasoning for this is because, if a student does not like any of the programs then it wouldn't be fair if he/she still had to choose one. Thats why its wrong for the principal to make this decision. Imagine a boy who just moved in from a different state. The boy had a lot of amazing, awesome friends that he had to leave behind. Now he has to transferred to the nearest school, having to start anew. His parents gave him the election forms and he has signed up for everything he needs. Only later to realize that it is a requirement to sign up for a ""extracurricular activity."" Although the boy does not want to sign up for an activity because he does not know anyone. Now put yourself in that students shoes how would you feel in his situation.

Most Students just want to get through the day, get home and relax. However, by adding this system the principal is adding a whole other level of stress for these students. I mean who would want to be forced into working on the yearbook or playing soccer yea absolutely no one. Students want to be free. Except with a required activity they have a whole other class to worry about and making sure that class has good grades especially if that student dislikes being there.

It needs to be a choice whether or not a student wants to select a ""extracurricular activity"".

I can see a probable reason the principal made this choice. I assume it is because the principal does not want there to be empty clubs/programs and that makes sense but it isn't fair to the students who do not want to be apart of any activities. Now it would make sense if the principal had a democrative system where the school voted for this option but thats not the case in however that is what the principal should do and the principal should ask the school to vote to get rid of the requirement or keep this way this can give the students, the principal and staff more reassurance. If the principal did do this then a huge weight is lifted off their shoulders.

Jumping to my next conclusion if a extra activity is required then this can cause stress and anxiety for students who dont want to be there. This can cause of lack of thinking process, failure in grades and bad attitude.

Let me explain. myself for example. If I was in a extra elective and I was forced to be in and i didn't like it I would start to stress then my grades in that class would start to fail, then slowly my grades in other classes would also fail. Now my parents would start to be disappointed in me and i would start building up anxiety. That anxiety if built up enough would most likely lead to depression and worse case scenario suicidal thoughts.

So in conclusion it is a bad idea to require a extracurricular activity.

Instead of forcing it i would heavily recommend choosing a activity because you never know how someone feels about certain things.",Male,8,Hispanic/Latino,611,655,646,36,11,58.72727273,56.34563988,39.54198473,259,655,Independent,Not economically disadvantaged,Mandatory extracurricular activities,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,"genericname your principal has decided that all students must participate in a least one extracurricular activity. for example, students could participate in sports,work on the yearbook, or serve on the student council. would students want to be forced into taking a program, club, or after school activity, no, of course not. nobody wants to be forced into doing anything in life. besides if a student was forced to participate in an program what activity's would they have. what if heshe doesn't like sports or working on the year book or etc. how does it benefit the student in any way. students should have a right to decide whether or not they want to join a club or activity. the reasoning for this is because, if a student does not like any of the programs then it wouldn't be fair if heshe still had to choose one. thats why its wrong for the principal to make this decision. imagine a boy who just moved in from a different state. the boy had a lot of amazing, awesome friends that he had to leave behind. now he has to transferred to the nearest school, having to start anew. his parents gave him the election forms and he has signed up for everything he needs. only later to realize that it is a requirement to sign up for a ""extracurricular activity."" although the boy does not want to sign up for an activity because he does not know anyone. now put yourself in that students shoes how would you feel in his situation. most students just want to get through the day, get home and relax. however, by adding this system the principal is adding a whole other level of stress for these students. i mean who would want to be forced into working on the yearbook or playing soccer yea absolutely no one. students want to be free. except with a required activity they have a whole other class to worry about and making sure that class has good grades especially if that student dislikes being there. it needs to be a choice whether or not a student wants to select a ""extracurricular activity"". i can see a probable reason the principal made this choice. i assume it is because the principal does not want there to be empty clubsprograms and that makes sense but it isn't fair to the students who do not want to be apart of any activities. now it would make sense if the principal had a democrative system where the school voted for this option but thats not the case in however that is what the principal should do and the principal should ask the school to vote to get rid of the requirement or keep this way this can give the students, the principal and staff more reassurance. if the principal did do this then a huge weight is lifted off their shoulders. jumping to my next conclusion if a extra activity is required then this can cause stress and anxiety for students who dont want to be there. this can cause of lack of thinking process, failure in grades and bad attitude. let me explain. myself for example. if i was in a extra elective and i was forced to be in and i didn't like it i would start to stress then my grades in that class would start to fail, then slowly my grades in other classes would also fail. now my parents would start to be disappointed in me and i would start building up anxiety. that anxiety if built up enough would most likely lead to depression and worse case scenario suicidal thoughts. so in conclusion it is a bad idea to require a extracurricular activity. instead of forcing it i would heavily recommend choosing a activity because you never know how someone feels about certain things.",5
DA43320FCA57,"This quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote ""to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else the greatest accomplishment"". People don't have to be something else as a greatest accomplishment. People are not being themselves in the world. This quote is not true because people are not achieving their goals, they are trying to be someone else, and they are not being about themselves.

The're not achieving their goals if the the world wants them to do something. People need to achieve their goals without someone telling what to do in their life. They have to know if they if the goals right for them to achieve, People with goals often don't like their goals because the world wants them to be something else in their lives. Often times people mistaken for want they want to be versus what they don't want to do. People who are not achieving their goals they go to be something else because they don't have a goal, or they are not themselves.

People are trying to be something else in their life by being not themselves. People have tried being themselves but failed because they can't find themselves. The majority of people will be something else rather than then be who they are inside of them. The world is a big place to be in for people and they don't want to express themselves out in the world, so they try to be something else to fit in. The majority of people who are something else are not happy for their decision because they are trying to hide their real self.

The majority of people are not being themselves in the world because they are not happy about themselves. People don't want to express on who they are in the real world and hide themselves. People are not showing who they are out in the world.

Often times people don't like to see themselves because they haven't found themselves.

People are most likely to go out at be something than to follow their goals.

Dear,

The teachers need to give homework to all the students when they are in vacation like to make presentations or something about all the classes for make sure that them are still remember the thing that could be do on the school so i think that the students need less vacation .

They just take the vacation to take rest or go to some places and do somethimg fun:

some students when are in vacation does not care anything of the school they just think in play or go out with friends and it does not help to practice and momorize.

Some parents does not matter if his child have a homework or not just because they are in vacation and they think that the teachers can't give homework.

The teachers need to give homework to all the students:

When the teachers give homework to the students they can not forget easily homework is like a practice.

The teachers can give more homework to the students that speak spanish because if they have homework the can learned some words in english.

DCDDFA12E124,"We humans aren't really perfect, there hasn't been one human that has never made a mistake, for example the person that is writing this prompt, has had a decent amount of failures in his life. One time he was taking a really hard test like this one, but he didn't know that it was going to decide if he is going to attend college or not, so he just sat down on the chair in Generic_School Library and he began to take the test, he had to take another year of high school, but he figured that he doesn't want to fail this senior year.

If he fails again he has to graduate with a bunch of kids, that doesn't sound right, does it? i'm from a family that always want their kids to be a doctor or an engineer, and they want to show to other parents that ""my child is better than yours"". So they kept putting pressure on me for months and years but it didn't seem to help a lot, but I had to make a change one day not because I was trying to make my parents happy or impress the other parents, but I was tired, I was tried of not having respect in the family, like anything that i said didn't mean anything to them, so I had to change, and with that change came a lot of consequences, for example losing my friends, not leaving the house as much as I used to, working less so it means less money on my paycheck by the end or every two weeks, but i didn't care as much, because I knew that this is going to be my last year at Generic_School.

I will learn from my defeats, and make sure that they wouldn't happen again, like one time I was working at Panera, my main job, and it was still my training week so I had no clue what the names for the dressing and the food was, so there is this computer above every line that tells you what the name of the food is, and it tells you all of the ingredients in the food and what kind of dressing that salad or what kind of sauce that food needs, so I followed the ingredients on the computer but i had made a peanut butter and jelly sandwich before the order i was making, and the costumer was allergic to peanut butter but i didn't know that so i made their salad with the gloves that was contacted with the peanut, so I gave the salad to my friend to bag it and he asked me ""Hey Generic_Name! did u make sure to change your gloved after each order?"" and I said ""I'm sorry, I didn't know that i have to change my gloves every time."" he said ""It's fine, just change your gloves and make another salad."" after that i have always changed my gloves after every order.

By the way my side job is detailing cars at all in one auto group located in Generic_City, VA. It's not a really easy job, but the pay is good, $50/hour, for a teenager that's a really good amount of money and imagine me working every day for a year and working 5 hours every day, yea, that is a lot of money for someone like me, last year i bought a lot of stuff with the money i made, I bought a car, a new phone, a really expensive watch, and a bunch of other stuff that u get when u have a lot of money, they don't affect your life, but they are just there, for entertainment purposes, like who really needs to have a Nintendo switch and a ps4 at the same time, like what type normal person would do that, you only do this type of stuff when you have too much money, and having too much money and not knowing what to do with it is insane.

Me failing makes me stronger, it's like you are running a marathon but every time you fall u get faster and faster, you keep getting closer to the finish line, and that is a good thing, the finish line is where we all are going to end up, but it depends what u do during this race that decides if you are going to win or not, if you keep failing and failing and not learning from it then I feel bad for you, but you have to focus and learn and decide what is good and what is not good for you, you should not be distracted by the stuff around you and your life. humans are stronger that what they think, i read somewhere that humans only use %1 of their brain capacity, imagine the day that we all would use at least %50 of it.

If you ever feel like u have be defeated in life, you are not correct, get back on your feet and started working hard again, there no way that you would do something the right way and not get a good result out of it, it's impossible to do so, unless you are pretending that you are doing it, in fact that used to be me last year, pretending like i'm doing homework, pretending like i'm listening to the teacher, but where did i go with all of that, just because I was lazy and didn't want to pay attention, I lost the race, but I got back on my feet this year, and i'm making sure that i'm happy, more than anyone else, I'm not going to let any negativity impact my life.

My dad used to tell me, he still does, but he says that ""imagine you are a racing horse and you have covers on your eyes, so you would only see in front of you"", apparently it makes the horse focus on the race but he said that ""you have a lot of distractions on your way but focus on what you have to do and only that, nothing else. just keep running and don't let the distractions affect your life, if they do you will lose balance and either affect someone else or you are the only one that will fall over, and that is not a good thing.""

In general just focus on your life have fun at times but make sure it doesn't affect anything and if it does, make sure that you, with the help of someone else or by yourself can figure out a way to resolve the situation, sometimes it's a really good option to get help from the people that you know, like for example friends and family or even the school counselor or the principal, just get some help if you think that you can't resolve it by yourself. so the former British prime minister called ""Winston Churchill"" is right about ""success consists of going from failure without loss of enthusiasm.""

did u make sure to change your gloved after each order?"" and i said ""i'm sorry, i didn't know that i have to change my gloves every time."" he said ""it's fine, just change your gloves and make another salad."" after that i have always changed my gloves after every order. by the way my side job is detailing cars at all in one auto group located in genericcity, va. it's not a really easy job, but the pay is good, 50hour, for a teenager that's a really good amount of money and imagine me working every day for a year and working 5 hours every day, yea, that is a lot of money for someone like me, last year i bought a lot of stuff with the money i made, i bought a car, a new phone, a really expensive watch, and a bunch of other stuff that u get when u have a lot of money, they don't affect your life, but they are just there, for entertainment purposes, like who really needs to have a nintendo switch and a ps4 at the same time, like what type normal person would do that, you only do this type of stuff when you have too much money, and having too much money and not knowing what to do with it is insane. me failing makes me stronger, it's like you are running a marathon but every time you fall u get faster and faster, you keep getting closer to the finish line, and that is a good thing, the finish line is where we all are going to end up, but it depends what u do during this race that decides if you are going to win or not, if you keep failing and failing and not learning from it then i feel bad for you, but you have to focus and learn and decide what is good and what is not good for you, you should not be distracted by the stuff around you and your life. humans are stronger that what they think, i read somewhere that humans only use 1 of their brain capacity, imagine the day that we all would use at least 50 of it. if you ever feel like u have be defeated in life, you are not correct, get back on your feet and started working hard again, there no way that you would do something the right way and not get a good result out of it, it's impossible to do so, unless you are pretending that you are doing it, in fact that used to be me last year, pretending like i'm doing homework, pretending like i'm listening to the teacher, but where did i go with all of that, just because i was lazy and didn't want to pay attention, i lost the race, but i got back on my feet this year, and i'm making sure that i'm happy, more than anyone else, i'm not going to let any negativity impact my life. my dad used to tell me, he still does, but he says that ""imagine you are a racing horse and you have covers on your eyes, so you would only see in front of you"", apparently it makes the horse focus on the race but he said that ""you have a lot of distractions on your way but focus on what you have to do and only that, nothing else. just keep running and don't let the distractions affect your life, if they do you will lose balance and either affect someone else or you are the only one that will fall over, and that is not a good thing."" in general just focus on your life have fun at times but make sure it doesn't affect anything and if it does, make sure that you, with the help of someone else or by yourself can figure out a way to resolve the situation, sometimes it's a really good option to get help from the people that you know, like for example friends and family or even the school counselor or the principal, just get some help if you think that you can't resolve it by yourself. so the former british prime minister called ""winston churchill"" is right about ""success consists of going from failure without loss of enthusiasm."" i agree with his opinoin.",5
58E485E875D5,"Try your best' Many people say this sentence to people who have test or have thier own projects. Because trying the best you can, will make better result than doing nothing. Like this, always doing something can accomplish more. More you tried, better result will came out. Such as Edison and many people who live successful life in our society.

First, There will be many mistake while making a decision. But we need to keep thinking of it and find a way. Example, Edison, who made a light bulb, do you think did he make it without mistake? No, there are a lot of failed experiments and mistakes. But he didn't stop to make it. He did keep practicing and, figure out other way to success making the light bulb.

Second, in our society, there are a lot of people who accomplish more than other. Almost of them always did something like practice their experiment, find a way to figure out it, think about their purpose and each way to make it correct. Also they wanted to solve question of their problems. People can't be inactivity to do these. Doing a lot of work, and never to be idle, can accomplish more.

Third, some people can say 'There are people who didn't work that much but live successful life'. If there are? That people was really lucky. Almost of them, there is no one who accomplish more, with out any effort. Idle people do not focus on their project then, how can they make the result better? Example, someone who practice everyday and, work until late night will accomplish more than lazy one.

Lastly, try a lot of thing and keep doing something will make you grow.

E3D9EE7C68F1,"Have you ever wonder how many enjoyable activities are outside of the world? They're thousands of enjoyable activities outside the world. Most people like to spend time with their families outdoors such as going to community parks, state parks, and national parks. Not everyone likes to go outside to spend time with their family, or go to a place to have fun because they don't like to go outside that much, but most of the times you need to go and look around what's around the world. I would prefer someone should go to and spend time with their family, or just to have fun such as going to the zoo, going to Disney or travel to a different state where you live.

The first reason, why someone should go and have fun is to go to the zoo. Most zoo's can be a little boring, but you can find a way to have lots of fun. The zoo can bring you lots of fun, and enjoyment such as taking pictures with the animals, giving the animals their food, and touching and giving love to the animals that are in the zoo. For example, at the zoo you can learn some interesting facts about every kind of animal that are you very interest in. Also, giving lots of love to the animals like talking to them or touching them is a way to be relax. You can learn new things about animals and the history, and it can be interesting and fun at the same time. In my opinion, the zoo is a great place and a great activity to have fun.

The second reason, why someone should go and have fun is to go to like a Disney park.

A large of number of people that I have known go to Disney to have fun with their family members. For example, at a Disney park you can go and try different games there, eat some different type of food that you haven't tried yet, and go and take picture of princesses that you really want to meet. For example, if you watch Disney princesses, you can go and meet them in real life, and talk to them. Also, going to Disney and trying games or riding any type of game is going to bring you enjoyment. It will take you the stress that you have, and you will forget everything that you been going through. In my opinion, Disney is the second best place to go and have fun by yourself or with the people that is around you.

The third reason, why someone should go and have fun is to go and travel to a different state, or country that they have never been to. For example, going to the Bahamas is a great place to go, looking at museums of what had happened in that place. Also, going to the beach in the Bahamas is another way to have fun, the beach is going to relax you in a type of way that you will not imagine. Exploring the world, or trying new things from a different state or country is a type of having fun, You can got to different parks, different beaches, and different restaurants where you can try different type of foods that you haven't even tried and that are the bets. In my opinion, going to different countries, or different states that you have never been is the third reason why it's a great idea to go and have lots of fun.

Many people like to have fun in different ways not just being outside. Most people like to spend time alone or with their family members. There's different types of way to have fun at different places not only going to the zoo, going to Disney a park, or going to a place that you have never been or explore what is it like to be in another country. Find a way to have some fun outdoors and all the things that keeps you stress are going get away in a second. Spending time in something that you really love is a great feeling that you will have experience in your life. Have fun with all the people that you love and that is around you because spending time with them and going to parks with them is the best feeling that you ever will ever have.

5E427A920EDC,"Thomas Jefferson wrote ""Determine never to be idle...it is wonderful ho much may be done if we are always doing"". I believe that Thomas Jefferson is right and we do accomplish more when we are doing something weather they are a fun things or a boring things.

firstly, when we are doing something there will be less free time in our hands and a lot may be done. For an example us teens when we get home from school we do absolutely nothing. We can be doing school work or homework but we don't, and that creates a lot of free time for us. Also, if every one in the world was doing something everyday to accomplish things I believe there will be less problems in the world. that is why I believe always doing things is the best way to accomplish many things.

Next, I believe always doing things is better than being inactivate. Always doing something can change many things in your life or someone else's life. Having something to do every now and then also helps you become more ready for the future. If you are inactivate, you are wasting your time doing nothing when you can be doing something for someone or helping yourself. if you are active you can be doing more things for something and someone then just sitting around doing nothing.

lastly, many people may say ""inactive is better than doing something"". Honestly to that i would like to say ""how?"" many people may say inactivity also has its purpose, and to that i can see how that works but being active is much better than just being a doll. knowing the fact that most people out in the world is very inactive or inactivity doing something is just sad and depressing. This is why i believe that most people should be more active when accomplishing things.

C7AC45EF9D03,"Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". I absolutely agree with that statement, because in my opinion I see success as a goal that everyone on this earth should somehow reach to. However, it's not that easy and not everyone is able to to that.

For example, my father is a successful business man by helping others and our family, he has done a lot for me. He also took risks and failed multiple times in order for him to be successful in life. Not just because he has a lot of money, because otherwise not every rich individual is successful. You must fail in order to better yourself and learn from your mistakes, because that will benefit you in the long run.

For me, I want to be a successful business man, just like my dad. I also want to travel around the world, and gain knowledge. but my goal for know is to pass all my classes with a high GPA, to show my parents and myself that I can do it. Yes, I failed one of my classes before but I didn't give up. As Winston said ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". I'm going to keep working hard in order to graduate and chase my dreams, just like my father did.

In the conclusion, I think that Winston said a true statement. I personally agree with him, because in order to be successful in life you will either need to learn from your personal mistakes or others. That's honestly what I am doing right now, since I'm still a teenager. Learning from others help you develop new skills and knowledge, especially from the old generation.

DA26E5E2C08E,"Many people believe that teenagers should have a 10 p. m curfew on the weekdays and during mindnight weekends. In my opinion I say having a 10 p. m curfew on the weekdays for teens that works and get out of work late might not be a good idea. Another example can be, you never know when an emergency can happen at your house and or anywhere else and you have no one to pick you up or an emergency hoccurs at your house and you have no one to take you, at least you got your son/daughter to help you out. Lastly during high school is when you get a lot of projects to take home and when you have test the next day and a project due before that can be a hand full and it can stress them out, by letting them do their work and have more time to study, it improves their grades in school and they do better in their classes.

I have a lot friends that as soon as they get home they get ready to go to work, and most of them come out at 10 p. m but by the time they get home it can a little more passed 10 p. m depending how far their job is from their house. Many teenagers help to support their family in whatever they can, having a job that can help them support your family is truly a good help. Letting your son work passed 10 p. m is not something you want to get in between due to thier boss changing their schedule sometimes and if hes helping you out by giving you money to pay a bill or to go buy food for the house it's worth him/her working a little late. I have friends that work very hard in school and after they home they change, they put on their uniform and they go to work to bring food the house due to his mom not getting payed good enough at her job. Others work to buy themselves their own needs, for exmaple when they have school dances and you need to buy a ticket and your mom has no money, by working you can buy a ticket and attempt to the dance. Another example is prom, prom can be one of the most exiting activities high school has, but it can also be very expensive if you have no money and your trying to look nice and presentable.

You never know when an emergency can occur at your house and you have no one to call or help you out. I once had a friend that his mom was pregnant and he had little sibblings that could not drive but him, and as the pain started to get worst he took her the Hospital and thank god everything turned out fine for them but the reaon they didn't call anyone else for help due to the fact they we're new in the city and didn't knew anybody and it was passed midnight, so his older son carried her to the car and drove her to the Hospital. You never know when an emergency can happen to you or someone in your family at anytime. Another example was when my dad and I drove to Walmart to buy my mom some medicine because she had a bad fever and a headche and we left the house exactly at 10:30 p. m and when we got back home we gave her medicine and the next day she felt a lot better.

During high school is where I have gotten a lot of projects that are hard to make and thier due two days later, not only do I be having projects, I be having homework from all my teachers and test that I need to study. Staying up late to complete your work can most definately help you complete your work or at least do more than what you couldn't had finished if you were to sleep at 10 p. m. Whenever I have a lot in mind like projects, homework, make-up work and test that I need to study really be stressing me a lot until a point where I feel like i'm being rushed and I can't concetrate right if I have other things in mind that I need to get done. But by having no curfew you can go to bed late, but at least you were calmed about it and you werent rushing into getting it done, when you took your time.

Many people can see 10 p. m curfew as something that should be done, but think about the consequences that it can have for example, not being able to work and help your family because can work passed 10 p. m or you never know when something can happen to anybody at anytime and there's noone to help out, or when you need more time to complete your project that you weren't able to finished due to curfew. Think about many other things that can be done, other things that can help others.",Male,11,Hispanic/Latino,820,871,858,19,5,171.6,57.39324619,31.34328358,273,871,Independent,Economically disadvantaged,Curfews for teenagers,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,"many people believe that teenagers should have a 10 p. m curfew on the weekdays and during mindnight weekends. in my opinion i say having a 10 p. m curfew on the weekdays for teens that works and get out of work late might not be a good idea. another example can be, you never know when an emergency can happen at your house and or anywhere else and you have no one to pick you up or an emergency hoccurs at your house and you have no one to take you, at least you got your sondaughter to help you out. lastly during high school is when you get a lot of projects to take home and when you have test the next day and a project due before that can be a hand full and it can stress them out, by letting them do their work and have more time to study, it improves their grades in school and they do better in their classes. i have a lot friends that as soon as they get home they get ready to go to work, and most of them come out at 10 p. m but by the time they get home it can a little more passed 10 p. m depending how far their job is from their house. many teenagers help to support their family in whatever they can, having a job that can help them support your family is truly a good help. letting your son work passed 10 p. m is not something you want to get in between due to thier boss changing their schedule sometimes and if hes helping you out by giving you money to pay a bill or to go buy food for the house it's worth himher working a little late. i have friends that work very hard in school and after they home they change, they put on their uniform and they go to work to bring food the house due to his mom not getting payed good enough at her job. others work to buy themselves their own needs, for exmaple when they have school dances and you need to buy a ticket and your mom has no money, by working you can buy a ticket and attempt to the dance. another example is prom, prom can be one of the most exiting activities high school has, but it can also be very expensive if you have no money and your trying to look nice and presentable. you never know when an emergency can occur at your house and you have no one to call or help you out. i once had a friend that his mom was pregnant and he had little sibblings that could not drive but him, and as the pain started to get worst he took her the hospital and thank god everything turned out fine for them but the reaon they didn't call anyone else for help due to the fact they we're new in the city and didn't knew anybody and it was passed midnight, so his older son carried her to the car and drove her to the hospital. you never know when an emergency can happen to you or someone in your family at anytime. another example was when my dad and i drove to walmart to buy my mom some medicine because she had a bad fever and a headche and we left the house exactly at 1030 p. m and when we got back home we gave her medicine and the next day she felt a lot better. during high school is where i have gotten a lot of projects that are hard to make and thier due two days later, not only do i be having projects, i be having homework from all my teachers and test that i need to study. staying up late to complete your work can most definately help you complete your work or at least do more than what you couldn't had finished if you were to sleep at 10 p. m. whenever i have a lot in mind like projects, homework, makeup work and test that i need to study really be stressing me a lot until a point where i feel like i'm being rushed and i can't concetrate right if i have other things in mind that i need to get done. but by having no curfew you can go to bed late, but at least you were calmed about it and you werent rushing into getting it done, when you took your time. many people can see 10 p. m curfew as something that should be done, but think about the consequences that it can have for example, not being able to work and help your family because can work passed 10 p. m or you never know when something can happen to anybody at anytime and there's noone to help out, or when you need more time to complete your project that you weren't able to finished due to curfew. think about many other things that can be done, other things that can help others.",4
4F3B770016BF,"In today's society teenagers have great opportunities to explore what they want to be in their future. Schools are associating with companies, so that the company can train them to see if whether they like the job or not. I want to go to a dental office and see what they do. The Doctor should select me to visit the office because I really want to be a dentist to help people that have bad teeth. Also if I go I would have an idea on how they work and persuade me to go to college. Another reason is that I would definitely have a great job and a better future.

I am currently taking a dental assistant class and I love that class because we learn different strategies every day and she gives us an idea on what we would have to do if we were dental assistants. I love helping people, and I want to be a dentist to help society; if they have any problems with their teeth. Having bad teeth is a struggle, my mom is a clear example, she is my inspiration and the reason why I want to be a dentist. All of her front teeth are fake, she lost them when she was young. Her fake teeth were extremely expensive; however, she got them. She did not have any problems with them until now, she says that they hurt and they also look awful. If I was a dentist I would definitely fix all of her teeth. I would also help others that have problems with their teeth. I will be so thankful if the doctor let me go to the office to learn and see what they do.

Adding to the previous paragraph, going to the office would be a great opportunity for me to learn how doctors work. Sometimes I feel like I would not be a good dentist because I am a shy person but other times I feel like I would be the best dentist because I am a very kind person. If the doctor allowed me to go the office to see how they work, I would get more confident about myself and start planning more on my future. Everyone in the office would persuade me more to go to college right after I finish high school. Right now I am struggling whether wanting to go to college as soon as I finish high school or take a break and start college a couple years after I finish high school. It would really motivate me if I went to see the office walk around, they showing me what they do, showing me all the instruments they use, how many hours they work, and how much I would be able to make if I became a dentist. It would be great if the chose me as the person that is going to the office.

Finally, if the doctor gave me the opportunity of visiting the office, I would encourage myself to go to college and study hard so I can have a good future. Seeing how they work is very important to make sure that, that is what I want to do for the rest of my life and that is how I want to earn money. Anything can happen at the office and if he chose me I would be extremely happy and I will definitely have a better future by looking at them and wanting to do what they do. I am a motivated person, I like to do what others do and experience new things. I like to motivate people and being motivated. If they motivate me I am pretty sure that I will go to college and will become a great dentist and that is going to give me a great job and future, not just for me, but for my whole family. It would really be helpful to be trained as a dentist before going to college, so when I am in college I can have an idea of how college works and try my best.

In conclusion, if I was elected to go to the office to be trained and see how they work would be helpful for me. It would really motivate me to go to college and become a dentist to help people and have a better future. It would also be a pleasure to work with the doctor for a couple of days, and see what they do and how they work.

5B2FC963E89D,"A person life, is like a little story, there way to think or act goes with what they have been though, some have gone from easiest to harder situations, there are many situations that people go through all the times. There own way to be, the way they go through situations, makes people take decisions or actions that someone that has gone through the same situation can help them inspired or make positive things in there life. Once you go through many situations it will be helpful to be inspired and think in someones life.

There are so many different opinions and ways to influence someone, they can be reasons or things that happened in the life of a person that will not necessary be inspired by a example of someones action, or life. Also a inspiration can make you feel confidence in a situation were you think you do not know what to do. The influence of a person can always be helpful.

A example is only main thing to influencing others, there are many different ways to inspired people. One example that I think is, that they can be moments were you do not need someone to inspired you, you need to think your situation because you are going to try to make it better by the way you think is the right decision for you.

Another example that I think of is, that we are humans and we are going to make mistakes and the people needs to learn from their mistakes, they can be many ways of trying to inspired a person but there times were you do not even think of someone to inspired you.

When people think of a inspiration or a motivation to do something they do not realize that they probably have been though the same situation but everyone is different, things may work for that person but that does not mean that it can benefit you, it should just be to see it as an example and try to make it better for you and get the positive things.

Sometimes it is just an coincidence that they have gone throng the same situation, and they feel identify not necessary inspired, it can also be a way to see how people can have many different ways to handle a situation, like what did I did that that person handle it different than from what I went through if it was the same situation, what can a make different if that situations happens again.

Is that there times that they feel touch by the way there life, or situation is similar to someone who when throng the same situation, it can be inspired by the way that they went throng the same problems, feel identify with something that happened to a friend, a family member, or them self. There are times that just by the action that someone can know, can feel, can think they way they felt in that situation, can be so influence by them, for knowing that you have not been the only one that went though that.

But it can be helpful to have someone that can inspired some one with there experience, sometimes people do not know what else to do they feel like there the only ones that have gone through the same situation, and a inspiration of a person can help them feel that they have someone who has been through that and that if they did it they can do it. It can also just be in there head that they think they need someone as an example just to be better or to feel confident with them self.

Most students in society think that they might know what their feature career is by just observing the career, and think that it is fun or easy because it might make them feel happy or make them look good.

Although some say that students should commit to career at a young age because students know what they might want and they aren't hesitant,actually committing to a career at a young age allows students to be less committed to a career they want because students are not as focused about their grades,but more about their career they might not want in the feature.

If students are committed to a career at a young age, students will have a hard time focusing in their classes in school and will be more focused on a career they might not want in the feature. Having good grades will help them stay focused and prepared for the career they might want after high school. Developing time to be prepared for their courses in college when in high school is important and it gives students much more time to prepare for their feature career. However,Students shouldn't waste their time on focusing on a career at a young age because they might not end up pursuing that specific career after high school or college instead of wasting their time on a career they might not pursue in the end, students should prepare for their exams and school work and after that they can focus on their feature.

Allowing students to take their time to focus on other things and giving them time to prepare for their career will help them make a right decision instead of rushing into something they might not want.

A5DCC6948E4E,"I was surprised when I read an article about Space X, and how they found a revolutionary way to send rockets to space and back to Earth. Space X, a company that did not have experience in how to construct rockets, started from an idea that still today is their main goal, this goal is to make a travel to space accessible for more people and not for just a few. However, a great project requires a great effort and dedication. Space X had many problems at the beginning of the project, the principal problem was how to land a rocket again to use them in future missions, they fail many times losing millions of dollars during the investigation, nobody believed they could accomplish it. Space X, is currently one of most successful companies wining millions of dollars by sending satellites to space. Failure always plays a really important role in the pursuit of success, without failure nobody could learn from their errors, failure is helpful to keep enthusiasm and try to complete it, and failure is really important to keep innovating.

Everybody tries to have success but many have fear on failing in what they are trying to do, people believe that if they try and fail, they will lose something, but the thing they do not think clearly is that if they never failure success will never be in their life. Failure is a opportunity to learn from the mistakes and how to correct them. For example, I had to create a rocket for my science class it was for a final grade, I could not find a effective way to make the rocket work, I was so nervous the presentation day was really close, so I made a prototype of my rocket to see what could go wrong and to find the most effective rocket, the prototype was a complete fail, the rocket not even could go up. I did several errors in my prototype that then I fixed in my final project, the day of the presentation of my rocket everything was perfect, because thanks to the failure I could fix the mistakes and had success in my project. Learning from a failure and knowing how to fix the mistakes is the best way to have success.

Sometimes enthusiasm is the reason why we do things, when somebody is enthusiasm in something, they can try even if they failure and sometimes failure is something that some people can not tolerate and they try their best to reach that goal, people who are really constant and know what they want, they do not fear to things that somebody else could fear. Enthusiasm can make people effort even more for what the want, and failure is the complement of enthusiasm, because if a person failure the enthusiasm to reach that goal gives him motivation to keep trying until reach the goal or success.

Innovation is something that happens every day, a new phone, a new car, all this is part of innovation. companies innovate to keep ahead from others, and some companies failure but sometimes this failure is not bad at all because this companies how failure understand that they were doing something wrong with the direction of the company. This allow them to create new services or products and be in a better track that they were before. For example, a person has a farm that produces only corn during summer, he provides all the stores in the county, but one day the demand of corn goes down and the farmer does not know what to do, he failure with the corn production and needs to sell the farm to pay tax, but then an extraordinary idea comes into his head, why not construct chicken houses and provide that chicken to big companies, the farm will produce more money, and will be a more stable farm. keep innovating even if we failure is the best form to have success.

Failure is one of the things is going to be with us the most part of our lives, the only thing we can do is to learn from it, if we go from failure to failure just be enthusiasm in complete our goal, and keep innovating. Failure is important because it gives us experiences that we will never forget and will help us react in a better form to problem that we could have in the future.

BBE9DDA6E3BD,"When I was in the fifth grader I went to the camp over summer the first day they made us do a project with a group to earn the title of the best group. The benefits of working in the group or working alone. Working in the group is more beneficial rather than working alone to work in the group is fun, makes me be more responsible and it is also the easier and creative way of finding solutions for the problem.

First of all, working in the group is fun. For example, I have a friend who didn't like to work with anyone or even talk in his classroom,,, one day his teacher put him with group of students after working with them he finally made a new friends and the work that teacher was giving them was much more enjoyable with mates. For that reason I think this is a great way of learning, communicating and building friendship with people around us.

Also group work makes us more responsible. I have friend his name is Generic_Name and I want to tell you something about him he is the most irresponsible student I have ever seen, but when it comes to a group work he is getting his job always done because he doesn't want his group lose the competition or simply fail the project. This made my vision clear that working with others makes people more responsible.

Some say working with a group distracts them from the task, but I will disagree with them because I believe, that working in the group helps you find the creative way of solving the problems. In my computer science class we usually work with groups so there is this guy that thinks he knows more than some of us and for that reason he didn't work with us, so we solved the problem the way that no one in our class has solved the problem this way and the teacher gave us extra points for being the creative group of the class, and the smart guy that I mentioned before couldn't solve that problem. This is way I don't like to underestimate my teammates or classmates I know that together we can be smarter, faster, and even

If the problem seems unsolvable together we can do it.

7600F1C7D884,"Would students benefit from being able to attend classes from home? I personally don't think students would benefit learning from home because you can learn better by being taught face to face, being able to know the ideas of you're classmates, and from being around people who already know enough to help you out. Being homeschooled would be much less stressful than from actually going to school, but if you really want to learn and be a scholar, I think you'd have a better chance going to school rather than learning from home because at home you can get distracted easily.

Being taught face to face is so much easier becasue you can ask as many questions as you need to help you with your problem. also, I think your brain focuses more when you're being taught face to face than from learning through a computer. For me it's so much easier to learn when being taught in person, because I concentrate more on the words the teacher is saying and when its through a computer I get distracted easily because there's no one around to tell me that I can't get up or go to the restroom. I remember this one time in math class I had an assignment I had to do and it was online, I could never understand it until I asked my teacher, personally, after that all the problems that we're similar to that one probelm I couldn't figure out, I did them in seconds and I think thats because I was being taught face to face.

When your in school you're never alone in a classroom because there's always other classmates and when you're homeschooled and it's just you by yourself. I feel like being in a classroom full of other people is better than being at home and learning on your own. Having people around you while your in class isn't always as bad, I know some people get distracted easily and not concentrate while being around others, but sometimes it's good to be around other people because you never know whose around and you don't know if the answer of one those people in your class can help you in any away. Me, personally, I enjoy working with others or even just having people around me, I feel less lonely like that and well I don't really get distracted as easily because I can talk to people and and at the same time concentrate on the work i'm doing, but that's just me i don't know how others are.

Thirdly, going to school is actually fun, you meet new people and you don't have to be locked up in your house the whole day. In middle school I remember that I wouldn't talk to no one that worked at the school because I didn't trust them, until this day I still don't trust them but it wouldn't hurt you to be around them and ask questions about something you need. Having people around you who already have been through everything were going through is very helpful because they know the steps to help you feel better since they've already been through it. Plus, you get more opportunities at school than learning from home, and that's because school can help you achieve you're goal and you're career, maybe not always but they can most definitely give you advice on what you can do to achieve you're goal.

In conclusion, I think you'd learn from home too, but you can learn more from school. This is to the people who homeschool their kids, wouldn't you rather have your kid at school where his safe, getting fed, getting his education, more opportunities on becoming someone in this world, and meeting new people in his life? or would you rather have him at home where his lonely and getting distracted easily? and it doesn't matter wether they're the ones who want to be homeschooled because you're the parent and your in control not them.

5FEB3F213A84,"Have you ever wondered how people are really good at playing an instrument? Have you ever thought what is used to make an instrument sound soft, low, and/or relaxing? Well I've found a really good instrument that might seem easy but its actually difficult to learn and to play in front of judges.

One of the most played and enjoyed instrument in a educational schools, concerts, and even TV shows is a ""Violin"". Violins are a really enjoyable and interesting to watch. But have you ever thought how hard it could be for a person to learn the music and strings? Well learning the music it's hard for some. Mostly if you don't know what string plays what. The most easiest strings for people are the ""D"" and ""A"" strings. These strings are mostly used in every sheet of music you get.

Movies play a lot of orchestra music. Not just regular music but ""Action"" movies. Why you might ask, well when a intense part starts the movie plays a soft violin. When the movie is getting more closer to the part they play 2nd violin, Chello and Bases. Chello and bases are loud and deep reasons why movies like to play them a lot. Have you ever went to a Orchestra concert near by? Well if you have you probaly know how loud they get.

An ""Assesment"" is basically were a orchestra teacher gets to pick 30 students from their advance class and take them on a mini ""field trip"" representing the grade level and school's orchestra.

An old proverb says that honesty is the best policy, however it might hurt someone's feelings and here are going to be some of the reasons why it dose. Honesty can be another way to hurt someone's feeling because, one they can hurt them self like cutting or something else like it, two they can even start a fight somehow, and three if you tell them they can even end there life. Am not trying to take it to far but yeah.

Just before I finish this I wanted to talked about the reasons above, number one if you hurt there feelings they might cut them self or do somethings worse to hurt them self and they might be doing it over and over again until someone knows and tell someone else about it. Number two, if you tell them honesty they might want to fight and I know that's not going to happened but lots of things happened and for stupid things too. They will get a good reason or for a stupid one and you don't want tom fight them they might be mad at that and were it becomes aonying and then everyone will hate it and maybe someone will start a fight with that person.

3D6C67E3EA20,"Self-esteem is having confident in yourself of being able to achieve a valuable assets. It is also the most important and valuable element in order to receive success in life. How can u build your self-esteem? Some people believe praising a student's work helps them build their self-esteem. Others believe achievement is the most accurate way of building a strong self-esteem. Does true self-esteem come from praise or does it come from achievement? Achievement is the true source of building a self esteem because it helps student set their goal higher and it motivates student to do more work.

Achievement is the best way to build a strong self-esteem because it helps student set their goal higher. Even a smallest achievement will make an individual a confident person. Watching themselves successfully complete a task will boost their self-esteem up. In fact, students will be wanting to set their goal higher by dealing with more difficult tasks which will help maintain their self-esteem and also expect much better results. Setting their goal higher would be the first step towards building a strong self-esteem. For example, achieving good grades on tests and exams, student will realize how important it is and will be wanting to receive even better scores next time.

There is no other way to motivate a student than showing their own achievements. By looking at their own results students will have confident to do their best. Their self-esteem will want them to do even better than their previous results. Students will not want to give up and will be wanting to try their best in order to beat their last score. For instance, a student taking their test will remember what they got last time and their only goal during that time to get better score than last time. No matter how small the achievement was, even if they failed their last test. Their self-esteem will motivate them from not failing again and getting a better score.

Some people might argue saying praising a student's work is the right way to build self-esteem. However, praising can undermines learning by lowering standards and also mislead student by not putting their best effort. Achievements are the most important element in building a strong self-esteem. It is also a efficient way to motivating individuals. The most beneficial way for students to set their standard high and receiving success is achievements. It does not matter how small or big the achievement is as long as a lesson has been learn from that.

D7C9E22CC216,"Graduating Early is a Bad Idea

Personally I think graduating in three years instead of the traditional four years should not be allowed. School should really think about this idea before making it an actual thing, because for some students this could be a good thing, but for some students this could be really bad.

Graduating early to me is a bad idea because, I dont think it gives students the right amount of time to learn everything they need to learn while being in high school. In high school students go through situations, make mistakes and bad decisions, learn how to fix those things and not do them again. Students find what they really like to do in life while being in high school but some students need a lot of time to find out what is that thing that they love and want to do for the rest of their lives. Students that play sports need to play for a good amount of time to get better at it and maybe get an scholarship, students that take mechanic courses or photography courses need a good amount of time to learn about everything they need to dominate on whatever they do, so that way colleges can come to their school, watch them and find out if they deserve a scholarship or not. While being in high school, students learn how to adapt to new environments, new people and even different languages so that way when they go to college they are ready for anything. Students that do want to follow this plan and graduate a year early, are going to have to go to school during the summers or in the evinings, if students do that then they won't be able to get a job and work what being in hish school and they won't be able to learn to manage their money and to figure out what's good or bad for them economically.

I have a friend her name is Generic_Name, she graduated a year early because she took online classes and stayed after school to graduate a year early. Generic_Name goes to college and has trouble adapting to the new environment and dealing with defferent types of people, Generic_Name is having emotional pronlems because she is not sure anymore about what she wants to do in life. Generic_Name and I talk everyday and she tells me about everything she goes through, she tells me she can't get a boyfriend because she doesn't know how to maintain a healthy relationship, she tells me she's having economical problems because she's doesn't know how to manage her money because while being in high school she worried more about getting her credits than actually learning what she had to learn to be ready to the real world.

In conclusion I think is a bad idea for schools to allow students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years of high school. Give students the right amount of time to learn everything they need to be ready for the real world.

F0EECEC5C84B,"Some people believe that they should seek guidance from experts and authorities about life' important matters because some of they wants to do all the things perfect they don't wants to make a mistake. But I think that is not necessary to seek guidance from experts. The first reason that I think that is not necessary to seek guidance from experts it is that you can learn new things in your life doesn't matter if you make a mistake. The second reason that I think that the people should make their own decisions it is that a expert does know every thing about your life does know your feelings.

As you can see my first reason that I think that it is not necessary to seek guidance from experts it is because people can learn new things in their life you can make a different in your life. Doesn't matter if you make mistakes you not are a perfect person. Every person learn about their mistake. Do what ever you want. The people does know what is better for you every people thinks different to what you think.

The second reason that I think that the people should make their own decisions it is because a expert does know every thing about your life. You can make your own decision. A expert can't choose what is better for and what it is not. Also experts can be incorrectly to what is tell you to do.

In conclusion, I think is more better to do your own things and do what you think is more better for you don't let people do the things for you.

68685615FE0C,"There is a debate about the opportunity offered by the schools for the students who live far, to receive classes without going to the school by way of online or video conferencing. Some people believe that the best way to learn is going to the school independently if the student live close or far and participating with more students in the classes. Other people believe that no matter on what way you receive a class, you always have the opportunity to learn something new. I believe giving the opportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn, because the student can pay more attention being alone, if the student have questions the teacher can answer them easily, and the student do not have to waist time going to the school just for one class.

First reason why I believe giving the opportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn because the student can pay more attention. Sometimes when you are in a classroom with more than 20 students is really hard focusing on what the teacher is talking about, because there are always some students who really like to make fun of the teacher, laugh with other students, interrupt the class with questions like ""can I use the restroom?"", and in someway you cannot even take notes; but when you are at home, all by yourself, without any distracction you can really be sure that you are paying atenttion and taking notes.

Second reason why I believe giving the oportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn because if the student have questions the teacher can answer them easily. For example, lets say that you are in a classroom with a bunch of students, each of them have differents questions about the class, and the teacher said that he is going to answer each question by alphabetical order, unfortunately, your las name is ""Generic_Name"". In this case one of the best way to get that question answer as soon as possible, is having a conference class between you and the teacher.

Third and last reason why I believe giving the oportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn because the student do not have to waist time going to the school just for one class. There are some cases where a student just have one class every day; what if this student live half an hour away from the school, it would be way more easy if this student can take all his classes in two days online, also, this can be a great oportunity to have a job while you are studying.

In conclusion, the opportunity offered by the schools for the students who live far, to receive classes without going to the school by way of online or video conferencing is so great, beacuse the student can pay more attention being alone, if the student have questions the teacher can answer them easily, and the student do not have to waist time going to the school just for one class. So, this opportunity offered by the schools to give this type of classes can motivate each student that live far to not excuse themselves to not finish a class, also, each school that do not have this classes should considered create them.

5922BC57820F,"I think this is not good idea ffom the schools to follow this model by esxtending this schools days for two more hoursand caming only 4 days schols. They are many reason why my schools should not follow this. One of the reason is because they will not save ennergy by making us came only for 4 days to schools. Anther reason is if they make us stay here for 2 more hours same same student the work in part time jod they will lose there job fron caming late. final reason why my schools should not follow this is because same Student in this school have babys and they have to go and take care of thent. those are my reason why my schools should not follow the rule

The firt reason why my schools shoukd not have the rule is beasue they will not same any energey. The reason why the schools will not conserve more energy is because we will still have to came liked normaly to schools them we use to. For example we came 7 hours to schools every day and they will make us stay 2 more the add up to 10 hours peer day. In conclusin we still be stiil doing the same hours peer week. So there is not a good idea by making us stay more time in schools.

Onther reason is the many student have to work went they get out from school so we schools to the they will lose there Job. If they lose there Job this Student will have any many to pay there bill and rent or buy there food to eat. So they will start to not caming to schools and looking for a day time Job in order to pay all the thing they need to play. So I think will not be a good idea because the Schools can make same Student to get from schools cuz they caming late to there part time Job

The final reason is the same girls in this schools have baby and they have go and pick then up to they day care cuz if she does't she will have to play extra mony. The will not be good for her beause she need the litke extra mony fron the baby also she will be late fron work. After she pick up her baby so go to a familu menbre and give the baby so afeter she can go and work in a part time job so she can get mony to take care of is babany and over came in schools so she can give a better future to her baby. If the schools to this they will hard many student the are trying the best to have a better future.

In conclusion there is not a good idea to the schools to this only for safe a little os ennergy they will hard many student. They can get hard by losing there Job they will not have many to play rent or food. So in order fron thent toget many they will have to start working in the days.

2147C68A6BE8,"What do you think is more beneficial working with a group or working alone. I don't like working alone because i feel like i am lonely. I like working with other people in the class because i think it will be easier and more helpful working with other students in the class. If you work with other students you will be entertained,working with each other, and you can divide the work with your teammate. I think working in a group is more beneficial then working alone

The first reason i say working with a group is more beneficial than working alone is you will help each other out by working on the assignment or project together. When your working on a group assignment and a group member is having trouble you can help them as a team. The grading will be calculated as a group so what we do as a team thats what we get as are grade. When i teammate is working and he needs you to get something like markers or anything else you can get it for them why'll their working. If a group member is absent you can do their work as a team in till their back .

The second reason working with a group is more beneficial then working alone is you can split the work evenly. If there is four group members each one will do one fourth of the assignment. If someone is absent you can do the work for them why'll their missing. It wont take long to finish the project or assignment if you split up the work evenly. If your teacher asks you to do an presentation you can split it by two doing the PowerPoint and two planing what to say during the PowerPoint.

The third and final reason i think working with a group is more beneficial then working alone is it will be entertaining working with other students because you can communicate why'll you work on the assignment. we will be talking about sports or any thing that comes to are mind while working. We will talk to other classmates out of are group and see what they think about are assignment. If we are have trouble doing something we will look it up on are smart phone. we will talk about what we are doing within the group.

I think group working is more beneficial than working alone because you will get help from your teammates and you will be splitting up the work between your teammates and you will be entertained by talking to your group and classmates. I think it will be better then doing the whole assignment on your own and stressing about it when you can have teammates that can help you. Another thing is it wouldnt take as much time if you were in a group then by your self. The counter claim of this is if you don't like working with a classmates or groups then you will have to work alone.

75D9A995F00C,"Some societies thinks that students should identify a career before entering high school, and should take courses that will guide them toward a specific career, but it's a good idea for students to commit themselves to a specific career at such as young age?. Taking courses in high schools that will guide students to a specific career is not a good idea because this will not help students to discover others things that they are good at and can be stressful.

During high school time students are not old enough to make a important decision, they should be taking interesting courses, and discover their essence.

It's essential for students to discover what they like to do, who they want to be, and what they want to study.

Making students to identify a career before entering high school could not help them to discover those things. Some people are already in their freshman year in college, and they don't even know what they want to study because knowing what you want to study in the future is tough and one of the most important decisions students will ever make in their life, and if they are not mature enough they could make the wrong decision and then regret.

When students enter high school i'ts important for them to take courses that they really enjoy.

It's true that taking courses that will guide them toward graduation are important because this courses will prepare them for the future and help them choose the right career. Taking courses that they are very passionate about is way more important because they don't know if while taking one of the courses that they really enjoy taking, they discover what they want to study. For example maybe a student is in a dance class, and he realize that dancing is what he really enjoy doing, and that is what he wants to study.

Choosing a career before entering high school can be stressful because it's a important decision. They cannot just say "" I want to study this career"", if they are not sure about it. Students should take time to choose the right career, and they should be very careful when taking the decision.

In conclusion should not commit themselves to a specific career at a young age because it can be stressful, and they are not mature enough to decide what they want to study.

9D33CC6B9AEF,"I believe that will be a great idea but, I'm disagree. Imagine, stay in the school two more hours. Our traditional time is enough. Others students and teachers will be disappoint with that idea. School shouldn't follow that model by extending the school day two hours because could affect our jobs, we will get stress and we couldn't spend more time at home.

To begin with, school shouldn't change hours because that idea could affect our jobs. There are many students work, some have more than one job. Also, many students are independent in this country. Extending the school day two hours would affect our jobs. During the afternoon all students who work start at 5:00pm or 4:00pm. If hours change in the school we can't have the opportunity to work. In addition, if you don't work how we can support our life.

The second reason I believe, extending school day two hours could be a disadvantages because students will get very stress. Furthermore, sitting in a chair for ten hours our body will become weak. Also, our mind wouldn't concentrate in each class. Teachers will get tired by supporting us. Our mind need to take a break. Elementary school and some of Middle School their mind are not strong enough like High School people. Elementary and Middle School can support the two more hours.

Lastly, changing the hours, students wouldn't get any benefit because students would not enough time at home. Teachers and students always have to do something at home after school. For example clean our house, take care our brothers and teachers their sons. Some spend time with their members like family and friends. There are many things to do at home like go to shop the necessary item that we will usually use at home. Our parents will be disagree because their sons don't spend the much time that usually do.

To conclude, by extending school day two hours that could be a disadvantages. Four-day school week it is enough for students. Also, that decision can affect our grades and homework. Additionally, changing school day two hours more, can be a conflict for all schools because we can't have option to work, we wouldn't concentrate in class and students and teachers can't have a special time at home.

A22EECAB91E9,"I support that schools should follow the same model as the business model who have adopted a four day work week to conserve energy and resources, energy, and extending the school day two hours, this kind of model could make them feel better to attempt to class, and start taking action about conserving energy and and think about our future there could be a day when our energy and resource comes to a end for humanity if we dont take actions.

However they should considered that energy and resources benefits us and the world, we mostly need energy in everything to survive and resources its a natural source of wealth or revenue that enhances the quality of human life, if businesses have adopted a four day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours to conserve energy and resource for their future, my school should follow this model because i think schools are the most who spend and waste energy and resource by their thousands of students that attempt there.

With a four-day school week , student would at least get rid of depression which adds unnecessary stress, they will have a one break day to do their homework and assignments without staying up all night just to finish it, at the same time it will benefit the environment by just having a four day school week , it will be harder for them to adapt for a longer days of school and a shorter week of school, some of them will not adapt to it but still it would help them to be more time at home with their family instead of be at school stressing.

Whatever, If parents and students got the benefit of having a day off, parent will have the time that they didnt have before with their kids they will more hours of work and school but still it may help them to have a better connections, and at least they would have a day off stressing and worrying about their work and assignments.

In Conclusion, cutting one day out of school would be helpful for young teenagers who are studying and working at the same time to help their families, and it would conserve much energy and resource than before, making our environment greater by conserving energy and resource in only four days of work for adults and four days of school for teenagers who attempt to any school.

I think that you shouldn't change the school policy so that student's can't participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average, because almost all student's won't be able to participate in the sports, and that will cause no players on the sports team. I also i think not to do that because the student's might protest again this rule, and bring their parent's to the school to argue about it.

DE20CFA52C1D,"What are the benefits of working with a group and working alone? I believe that working in groups helps you to have more ideas, more knowledge, because if you communicate with your group members, they'll think about different ideas to proceed the work that is getting done. Working alone sometimes helps you more than working with groups because you are responsible for your own work.

I rather work by myself because I've had bad experience working with groups. When I work in groups sometimes I'm the one that has to do all the work, and in my opinion if we are working in groups we have to help each other, communicate and share our thoughts because if we don't do that what's the point of working in groups. However, I think working in groups is important because you can come out of your comfort zone and be free to share your thoughts with your group members, and you can make friends too. For example, I'm a very shy person, it's rare the times I talk in class but when I'm in a group I have to talk, share my thoughts with my group members and communicate with them.

Reasons why I prefer working alone are: I focus more doing my own work, it's only my responsibility not others, I have to worry to turn it in on time, if i get a bad grade it's going to be my fault not others, I'm responsible for my own actions, I have to make sure if everything is right to get all the credit.

Reasons why I don't like to work in groups are: sometimes they're not responsible for doing their part, if they do their work they do it all messy( you can't even understand their hand writing), they play around too much because sometimes they take it as free time, they spend most of the time on their phone instead of doing what they are supposed to do, sometimes they don't do their part in time and we have to turn it in late and don't get all the credit.

I believe working in groups is beneficial but at the same time it's not, I think it depends with the people you work with, because if you work with people that do their work and actually care about school they will definitely be beneficial and make your group work out. If you work with someone who doesn't care and is always playing around, you won't get anything done and will receive a bad grade unless you do all the work and the other person will just get credit by not doing anything, in that case there is no point to work in groups.

In conclusion, I believe it's more beneficial to work alone than groups because you can focus more on what you're doing and take responsibility of your own work, because if you don't take care of your school work nobody is going to do it for you. So you have to chose what's better for you and what's going to benefit you more, but for me I feel like working alone is more beneficial for me than working in groups.

F4BE7BB77A43,"Tomas Jefferson say is wonderful how much may be done if always diong. And is one of the reason I deagree with Jomas because if the person always doing something learning stuff they never before do. Is wonderful how much the person can be do and learning new stuff if always work hard. One of the many reason of the human is a intelligent,stroong,smart and do new stuff no matter if they are easy or difficult. If they work hard can be do everithing.

For example the human not born with the capacity to walk or speak all human learng how do new stuff not matter how dificult ther are because more do more learng. One of the big point of always do somehing is prepare for life,is not easy but diong something to make sure the person is in the right way is the most important things the person need to know. Teaching personality and work hard is the big stuff, however one point of life the thing come hard but teaching how go and do resolve the problem. Not matter how be is the problem you need to go and do something then make how strong the person are. The person need to struggle with problems but learning and work hard is the main reason why the person is strong. On one point has the access to take something and work on that, but doing something is how learning new need stuff. Example the person who invent the technology they work hard and always do somethig to make they dream to come real and thas why diong somethihg and do the best potential is how make all the stuff of life. The person who study and prepare to make thay dreams are those work and not matter hoe big is the way they make one aesy way to continue they dream.

Doing somethigs always is the reason why the society do big work define new thing new technology new life becuase always are doing somethis. The person not born with all the intelligent not they learn how walk,speak and one point of life they go to school they not know everything. Not they do something the work hard, however a lot person are very smart but they continue to learn always doing something because they want to a better because they want to suppor the world and they family a better place. Likely the most professional always do something to make sure they life are excel of the most difficult piont of they life becuase always work hard and make new things, because not matter how low they education the person take always can be a better person because always try to define the best decition and the best example to the society. A different way to make the personality strong is find new ways to the problem. Life is like a game more things more work more aesy is to make the things.

If the person always are diong something new and the not choose to stay an d the same place all the time. And the person choose to continue doing new stuff and new work they not need to be the most smart person on the world. They need to work and show they can be do,however they walt to be not matter if they how be a stong personality and not matter is they't go the best school or the best college. Only matter how they be and the profession and the work. If the person or the society do somethig they can be the future. For example one day the person get up and choose to do something and make sure they days are very beautiful do new projects they can be came be make they life more aesy to continue. Life and work are like a gardener more flowes the person add more beautiful they came to be is like work more thing you learng more easy life come. one point they persono can't be continue but all the things thy learn more aesy came to be going up.

That why more things do make goals they persons can find, not matter were the person came or were the born always doing something more intellegent the person can to be. However a lot person are very smart but they continue to learn always doing something because they want to a better or find new technology or make a different on this world.

They would not be concentrate what the teacher is saying when they are surround by their friends in class. However, some people say that it is benefit for students to attend classes from home which is true, because they would pay more attention, also It reduces the death at schools.

Allowing, students attend classes from home by the way of online. It is a great opportunity for certain people who are not able to go school for some medical issues. For example, students who has disabilities to move or not suppose to go out. They could make a video conferencing and complete their assignments from home. They would be safe and feel happy that they are part in the society. Moreover, it can also decrease the risk of bullying suicide that happen in schools. For example, in the past days, a student commit his own death, because his friends was telling him that he is fat which is not nice at all. Schools are a pyramid of knowledge. Teachers should civilize students by teaching them the risks and inconvenient of bullying. Students tend to kill themself just for bad words. It would affect their life in the future by committing crimes. For example, school shooting, they have a discuss and get mad by their co-workers or friends. This kind of things make them feel that they are frustrating by the society. One day, they come school with a gun to get revenge by shooting people. which will give schools a bad reputations.

Some students have a hard time to focus in class. Attending, school from home by online or video conferencing will help them, so they can pay attention in class without being distracting by their friends. For example, some students love making jokes when the class is quiet. They will get others people is attention, so no one will focus on. Some of them want play games when they see their friends and helping each other cheat on their test. Distracting, students during class could fail them, because they would not understand their assignments. Concentrate, will allow students to pay more attention and have a good understanding. Staying at home can make them feel comfortable. For example, some students are too shy to ask questions in class. Using online or video permit them to ask questions by sending email to the teacher, and participate in class.

One example of build self confidence is that we can believe in our self in what we can do. another reason is that we can feel confident by making our own plans. last reason to build our self confidence is that we have the ability to create our own future by making good decisions. Taking our own decisions always help us to feel confidence because we feel like a responable person in each decision maked.

Taking our own decisions helps us learning to be independent. One reason is that we learn to work by our self by making the decision to create our own businees without be guidance from a experts. Another example is that we learn to get up by it self, when we fall down by a bad decision. Last reason is that we have the right to do better if we get something wrong in our lives by a bad decision. When we make a good decisions by our self we feel independent because we are learning to live by ourself.

The people who make their own desicion, they are developing own skill. When we take own decision we are improving our knowledge becuase we are understending about what are the good decision and bad decision. Another reason is that we are learning to develop our own personality because making desicion help us to get more experience in our lives. Last reason is that to make decisions also help us growing like a person because when we take decisions they make feel us with confidence that we are people with great capacity to do anything. Make decision in our lives help us to develop our own skill because we are understanding how hard is live if we select a wrong decision.

Make owns decision always help us to grow by ourself. By doing own decision we can build self confidence to be a successful people in our lives. Practicing own decision help us to be independent and make feel us as a responsable peoples.

3CDE1D9E6E57,"One topic that is frequently debated in some societies is if schools should offer distance learning as an option to benefit their students. Parents would disagree with the thought of having their kids staying home and learning but I believe that students should have distance learning as an option and let me tell you why. Every student learns at a different pace, students often debate on showing up or staying home from school, and not all students require the same classes.

First reason why i believe distance learning is beneficial and should be offer at schools is because not every student learns at the same pace. Some students would require a little more time on an assignment as the others would not. I grew up in a community where teachers didn't ask if you'd understood the lesson, or if you needed help, they would just keeping moving forward, which had a huge negative impact in my grades. Having one on one lessons with teachers and getting the proper education without actually being there, but through a computer screen on the other side of the state is a game changing experience that students would love and should be willing to choose from.

Second reason why i think online or video conferencing is beneficial to students is because like most students, they wake up exhausted in the morning, and debate whether they want to go to school or stay home. Missing a whole day of school instead of starting at the time you want could really hold you back from getting your education. I have a friend who chooses to stay home instead of coming to school because he feels like once he gets to school no one helps him, but when he would take his classes online he would have all of his work done and still have time to start on the next lesson. Online classes are very beneficial to students who find school difficult.

Third reason to why i believe students should require online learning as a benefit is because not every student can get the subject or class required for graduating at their school. Many students shouldn't require taking all the basic classes if its not necessary, if a student is focusing on becoming an architect they should mainly take classes for that instead of classes to become something else. Online classes also give students time to reflect and explore more learning options.

As you have read i believe, that students should get the opportunity of getting online or video conferencing as it does help students to focus, get their work done, and farther their education.

E21D14227555,"A wise man once said ''the usage of technology has had an impact on humans contact for centuries''.The usage of technology has had a positive impact with human contact because people can see what others are doing for fun and it can result in finding people that are from other countries to become your friend.

Sense technology has improved through out the 20th centuries people argue that technology has caused limitations on human contact but that is far from being right. People have been brought closer thanks to the invention of the internet and it wouldn't have happened if technology wasn't improved. The internet has opened a whole new world of opportunities and awesome people to meet. People can laugh at a funny mems together and create groups where their you can talk about what ever you want. People can even ask others if they would like to be friends with you. Having the internet,people become more confident in being their true self. People can see how much fun a family is having and it can persuade them to go and try the place and experience the fun for themselves.

With technology people have learned how to do things by watching videos of someone else doing it or by calling a friend. Video games have also has let to people having to talk on the mic and being able to comunicate with each other. People can also build their sense of being a leader as they play a game they can ask people to saty with each other.

151ADAD693F8,"Impressions are always possible to change. In today's day, we decided what to do or not. Also, we can change impressions based on others experiences. Another thing that you can do is ask for help. Some impressions can made you to do bad decisions or good decisions. First all of, We need to think, and than we need to act. Do not act before thinking because you can do something that is going to be imper durable. ''Characteristic trait or feature resulting from influence''.

Many people believe that impressions are almost impossible to change. But, I believe that impressions can always be change because we are humans and we can feel little things. At this time, Some many people had die because they do not know what to do with they impressions.

Impressions are one thing that everyone in this world have in their lives. Without impressions we are going to be something else. Sometimes others people impressions can be so hard that we need to ask for help. Impressions are influence by effect on feelings.

To change impressions based on others experiences can help you more to become a better person. Do you think can you be a better person with others experiences?.Others people experiences are not going to make you the same us them. Everybody are unique and they have their own methods to solve their impressions. Solving impressions is one thing that we always going to do to feel much better. Some impressions can effect you more than others. For example, fouteen years ago, I was really affected by an impression that I saw on the street. There was a girl and her boyfriend having sex where the bus stop and I was there and they did not care at all. That affected me because that is not one thing the people have to do in the streets. Also, I was only seven years old. At the time I did not what they were going. In addition, I was not the only one who saw that, there were many people walking around seeing what they were doing. However, two days later I talked with my mom Generic_Name about that and she help me to understand why they were having sex on the bus stop. She told me that they were using drugs. Three months later, I become the same person who I was before that impact.

People can do unfavorable things by getting an impression that they did not like. Sometimes people do things without thinking. That is why, I always say that before you do something, we need to think and than we can do wherever we want. Anyways, bad things are not going to help you to get out of the impression. In my opinion, when we are in an impression that it really affect us, find a person to talk with and maybe that person helps you to feel a little bit better. Good things and bad things are always with you. But, ONE thing that you have in your personality is that you can decide which one you want. Those two thing can not get you as you do.

It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. But, based own my experiences I can tell you that; Yes, you can change an impression. Our lives are made it with two personalities. You choose which one you want. One of those is friendly and the other one is cocky. I choose those two words because friendly represent a good person and cocky represent a bad personality. Not everyone in the world can get out of a strong impression. There are some people that they can not be who they were. Are you want of those?

Everyone has a talent and a skill. I personally think that my talent is photographing, but photographing take skills as well. Taking pictures is relaxing, fun, and cool at the same time.

Photographing is I guess not easy and hard because while taking pictures you have to find the right angle the your photo and as well you can just take your picture in your own way.

How I developed photographing is by going out and looking at intense images.

when I go out, I always think about if I should take some photos of whats there like: the River

People, and maybe other Cities as well as Nature. While taking pictures, it's really relaxing because you can feel the wind breeze on your face and you can release your stress.

For me I think that its fun because you can take pictures whatever you want, I also think that taking pictures is cool because you can see how things looks like up close how it looks like on camera.

How I use it is by releasing everything that is on my mind. I also use it for improving my skills as well. For me sometimes its a little bit hard because I need to find the right angle for the photo Im taking. My photograph skills aren't that good, but I practice everyday so I could take better images.

During my free time I go out and find some photographic things like: Insects, the Moon, and other objects, and take pictures of them.

D948703E8026,"Should the city council adoption the curfew of a 10 p. m weekday and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers?

You often hear people say that teenagers are costing more problem to other people and for the around them environment. The city council should adoption the 10 p. m midnight curfew for teenagers because teens would stay out of problems, and they would have more time to do school work.

To start, the curfew would avoid teenagers being in problem with the law. For example,teens with the curfew would not be in gangs or cost problem to others. Lets say that teens had the curfew it would expand beyond the level of doing good to others and staying out of gangs or doing bad stuff. They would be able to achieve their goals fast and force on what is next in life. Even though, this curfew sounds bad its not bad because teens would learn that the curfew is just to help them and help the environment around them.

Secondly, the curfew would allow teens with more time on their schools work and have time to force on their work. For example, teens would have more time to focus on their schools work than being on the streets with gangs. With that being said teens would have a chance of achieving their dreams and being successful in live without a bad influences. In this scenario, it show that a curfew is not bad because it has some good way in live and it allow people to do good stuff for others. Ultimately, with this curfew it allows young people to see the better side in life and it would help them to stay focus in schools by achieving their work and doing the right things.

Some people may say that having a curfew is unfairly interfere in young people lives. For example, young people have the right to choose the way they want to be. Therefor, being later in night dose not meant that young people are doing bad stuff or their are in gangs also they are just having fun in their way. Thus, being in a curfew it show young people that their are controlling by other people just because they have a different way of having fun. In this scenario, it show that having a curfew is just unfairly for teenagers just because other teens got in trouble it dose not means that all of the young people needs to have a curfew.

In conclusion, the city council would just being helpful to the young people by add a time limit.

46302B93EF09,"Dear Generic_Name,

I know you're still a little young to understand what technology means ,but I believe that technology has had a negative impact on us. Technology has increased the rates of kidnapping, human trafficking ,sexual abuse ,and murder.

Due to technology we are also losing our eye sight. It has also limited our communication skills .

Young adults usually download dating apps to meet new people ,but they don't understand the risk they can get them self into. For example they usually meet someone online and start talking. After awhile the guy probably ask her out on a date to go for a dinner ,and of course the girl is going to say yes because she's interest in the guy. Few days later the guy ask her out on another date to go and watch a movie ,but he say's that he's going to pick her up; and that were it all start she get in the car thinking he going to take her to the movies ,but instead he's taking her somewhere else he's going to kidnapping her and she doesnt know. she goes missing for weeks and no one knows where she's at. A few days later they find her body dead.

Now in day more and more people are using glasses. Technology is ruining our eye vision. People that work in offices are more likely to be using glasses now in day. They sit all day looking that their computer ,but they don't realize that their eye sight is getting bad. Young adults are also using glasses too because they use their phone to much or watch to much TV . One way to prevent that is you could put your light dimer on your computer and phone. You could also set your self a limit for how long you're going to use your phone or computer.

Another reason why technology is bad because it limits our communication skills. More people are getting used to working independently. Teacher will usually give us a project assignment; we can either work with a partner or work independently. Most students like to work independently because they don't like to rely on someone else finishing the part they had to work on for the project and not doing it. We are also able to text or video chat with other people instead of talking to them in person. By talking to someone in person it can also increase your self esteem.

In conclusion these are my reason why I believe that technology is not good for us. Technology has impacted us a lot in society. We need to be more careful and caution about the new technology we are going to be inventing in the future. we also need to be careful with the action we take.

The first reason I believe asking people for advice is good because. When asking more people you can get a new view of others perspectives. Then from there you can ask anther person to see what he or she think. For example if you are doing a project and you are stuck you can ask a friend for his or her opinion on it and possible you can get a different stet of eyes on your topic.

Anther reason seeking multiple opinions can help someone is by.

If you are not sure about what you should do you should ask someone before you don't do it because if it is something bad that friend can save you from doing it. For example if you and your friend are doing something bad you should ask a person next to you if what you are doing is allowed. I

f they said it to you now you no that what you are doing is wrong and you should tell your friends that we should not do it and leave.

The school board should not add one and a half hour to school each day because most students have stuffs to attend after school. There are many students who take after school clubs and activities. They should have enough time to prepare their self's for the activity they are doing. If the school decides to add one and half hour than the students will have hard time focusing on their activities.

Did you know that seeking multiple opinions can help you to make a better choice ?

It can help you to learn who you sould and should not trust to know who wants the better for you , who doesn't care about you , and to not trust everyone.

In 2006 a girl who mostly didn't know how united states school works needed to make a desicion of going to summer school or not she was failing the grade because she did not understand anything , she wasn't having a good time with social studies ,english,and math so she asked who she thought that were her friends when she got home she asked her family if she should go so she can pass the grade,her family said yes but her friends told her that summer school doesn't help to pass the grade it is just if you don't want to be all summer alone in your house her family told her that her friend were liying however she didn't want to believd in her family .After she took the desicion of trust her friends and not her family .She didn't go to summer school and she failed the grade because of all her grades were mostly in F and that she didn't want to accept to enter into summer school because of trusting her friends after she failed the grade because of her desicion the girl noticed that her friends didn't care about her beause they told her the worst advice for her to fail the grade ,they didn't want the girl to pass to the next grade . I f you trust someone who wants the better for you everything will end up good you will not have any problems, but if you trust someone who doesn't care about you and you don't ask anyone also not everything will end up good because they will give you their worst opinion because they don't want the better for you. People can learn to not to trust everyone because sometimes people might think that just because they are friends or they know them for a lot of time they are are giving them the better choice.

Another reason of why it is important is because you are not going to make a mistake of choose a wrong advice , end up wrong ,and to loose the opportunitie of which you were looking an opinion for.

In 1990 a very smart girl won a schoolarship in one of the best colleges of the county, but she didn't know what to do so she asked her friends about what she should do , when she asked her friends they told her that she shoud not accept it , the girl didn't know what to do because her friends told her that they were not going to go to that college, the girl listened to her friends and choose to not to accept it , when it was almost time to go to the college her parents told her that she wasn't going to go to a college because they didn't have the money to afford for one, the girl stayed at home without going to college and start the carrier that she wanted because of her choice .

That's why it is important to seek multiple opinion so you can make a better choice and to no to choose the only advice that you had in which everything ended up wrong and you will loose the oportunitie and maybe not have it again.

Finally it can help you to make a better choice so you know what's bettter ,not loose the opportunitie, and everything will end up well.

You can know what's better because you have a lot of advices and you can choose the best one, you are not going to loose the opportunite because you had a lot of advices and not just one in which you didn't have lots of opinions that could help you ,everything will end up well because people gave you all those advices to help you choose the better one.

In 2002 a 14 years old boy noticed that there was an opportunitie were a club theater wanted people who wanted to learn to act that boy liked theater so much that he wanted to enter into that club , but he didn't know if it was a good idea or not , so he asked his friends, parents , grandma , grandpa, and teacher about what they think aboit it .He had lots of opinions and he could chooce the one that he though it was better, he choose his family opinion which was that if he likes theater he should join that club and that's what he did he entered and everything ended up well he learned to act well and he started to appear in television wining a lot of money and now he became one of the most famous persons in the world and everyone ask if they can have his autopraph.

Seeking multiple opinion helped him to make a better choice and to not to loose that opportunitie that he had .

In conclusion seeking a lot of opinions have many ways to help you not to make a mistake just like in some of this cases people made not all of them didn't but the ones who didn't make a mistake were people who asked not just to one person they asked to a lot of people so they can choose the better choice . You can learn who to trust because sometimes we think that just because they are our friends they are going to give us the better choice when its not like that .

Dear principle,

Community service should be a job, not for students to perform. Requiring students to do that job is very difficult, especially during school days. Community service should be a job that the government should be giving to people who don't have jobs. Students should have their time in school and after school to learn and enjoy part of their life. Example, that of a person who comes back from school, tired and with a lot of homework to do. If he goes to do that service, he might not do all of his homework. And if he stays late to night to do it, he will not focus the next day. So that will hurt the student from both ways. As my position was stated to you to read, my advice to you is; at least help some students get our of this difficult service. And if the community needs some help as stated; take them in a specific day during school. But if it's everyday, community service jobs should be announced.

6B3B3CB54EB9,"My opinion about conserve energy and resources.

I have two points of view, the bad and the good one. I think this is a good idea but, it has bad things.

I think if we want to conserve energy and resources we just need to have four-day school week. Four-day school week can be benefits for the people that have to work everyday, but it has a disadvantage and is that we are not going to learn to much like a five-day school week.

My first point of view is that this can be good for many students. If my school follow this system can work for many students that have to work every day. First reason is that they can have one school-day off so they can go calm to the job. They can have that day off in school and job. Second reason is that, this can be good also for those students that skip school everyday, maybe if they know that we just got four-day school week they would want to come to school. Third reason is that teachers can have more time to work on projects and do all that work that they have to do.

Second point of view is that is system can not be a good idea. First reason is that students would not learn as much as five-day school week. Second reason is that is going to be tired to be ten hours of school. Third reason is that two more hours of school are not a good idea for those that have a part-time, they would not be on time in their jobs. Two more hours of school can be frustrate for many students.

My position on this issue is that this would not work. First reason is that many students that have to work they would like to go to school beacuse of two more hours. students that have to work start they shift at 5 pm and school would end at 6:04 pm, students would skip the last classes. I think if this is to conserve energy and resources it would not work beacuse is like they are adding part of the last day of school to each day so like the same think.

My conclusion is that is not a good idea my school sould not approve this issue. This like the same think as five-day school week. If they don't add two more hours this maybe can work, but I think this going to be hard for students and teachers. With this system we are not going to conserve energy and resources is going to be the same thing.

6B7240C22E28,"Yes i agree we can accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose. Because when we do something that will brought something good in ou life we can do. For example the President want to do something that can make everyone to be happy, he want to make sure his country look good or when parent work they don't work for themself, they work for family to be happy. I think many people do serve on porpuse to make better life. some people thing that maybe when inactivity you can't accomplish your goal but what i believe if your do something with one heart everything may going good in the life. And that why in this life you can't stop to do something can make you happy or make your life great.

The is some people are very laziness, the can not do any anything , they're job is to sit down everyday play game or drink alcohol and smoking. The some people they don't have any place to stay because they're very laziness to find a job. they're thing government can help them everything. But that still bad for someone who have two hands and two legs. And they's some people people they don't have hands and legs but they still work to make they family better life. For example American people want they're children to be educated because they want when they grow up to have better life. They don't want to see they children suffering in the life.

We need to fight for our life to be better. Because when we put laziness out of our ways everything may be good in life. And in the life we can have easy life don't make your life hard. Because when you have piece and love in your heart anything can be hard for you. When you have any problem you can try to solve yourself and don't stop to do what your heart say. we need to go through in this life. But in our life don't truth anyone and believe what your heart say. some people thing life is hard but people are the one make themself hard life. we need to not give up in our life. let work together in this life.

Let think of this why Thomas Jefferson wrote, Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing. Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity alson a serve a puporse? It's because he think if people do something together can make they're country look better place or can make people feel good for what they see in the country. For example when you have farmer and you can make sure that you farmer look good and that why Thomas want his country to look good. when you have better parent everything for you will be well.

In my my idea people don't win everyday in the life the's win and lost, or defense or loss, so we need to fucor in our life we need to stop be laziness. We need to make our country look good. we need to have love and pieceful. For when you have someone love you so much and you don't need to hater someone because you have someone who love you so much.

E56D7CC27444,"Some people believe that glorifying a student's work might help them build self-steem, even when they have not put a lot of effort into it. They believe that students should be confidents in themselves in so they can learn. Others believe that glorifying a student's work that does not have a lot of effort into it lowers their levels of learning. They believe that in order to build self-steem they must complete achievements. I believe that students do not need others to praise their work, even when they did not put enough effort into it. It would make students think that what they did is perfect and that they do not need to work more on it or to do some more effort to achieve what they want. Although some people might not agree. They would think that it is a good thing to glorify students work only to make them feel confident. However, I firmly believe that students should put effort on what they do and that they do not need other people to praise their work only to make the feel confidents with themselves.

One reason I believe students do not need to be praised on their work is because it would only make them rely on what they have and not work to achieve more results. They will not do more of what they are capable of. In addition, they will not put more effort on what they need to do. They do not need others to praise their work only to make them feel confident with themselves. Finally, students will always need others to tell them what they did is amazing to raise their self-steem. This matters because there are people who still believe that praising a student's work will help them to be self-consident.

Second reason I believe that students do not need to other people to glorify their work is beacause it would make them think that everything they do is correct. Students will think that they are not capable of doing more than what they believe they can do. For example, they will always check their work with others only to feel confident with what they did. In addition, I think it is best to tell students that they need to be confident with themselves instead of praising their work. FInally, students do not need others to praise their work in order to be self-confident. This is importan because people have to tell students that they need to be self-confident, even when what they did has not their best effort.

Third reason I believe that achievement is the key to build self-steem is because only achieving what we want we can feel confident with ourselves. I think that to build self-steem we must put a lot of effort to achieve what we have to do. Students need to achieve what they have to do in order to be self-confident. This matters because students should know that they need to work hard and that means to put their best effort, if they want to build self-steem.

In conclusion, I believe that people should not praise the students work only to help them build their self-steem. Sometimes they have not put their best effort in their work. They are going to feel that they are always doing exactly what they needed to do, even if is not like that. In order to be self- confident students must do achievements.

C82037D6072F,"Befits For An Extra Hour of School

85% of students who study more can pass more test. I feel like some students could befits from an extra half an hour of school because it could help students learn more. Also some students struggle with some subjects so it could also befits some students who can not stay back. School should add an extra half of a hour to school because it could help students get more education, better job opportunity, and help students to be better prepared for test.

First, students with more education could help students lead to success. Education is helpful because it is need in a lot of daily activities. Education is also super important because it is through out life. Also some students who want to get in a good collage but do not have the money for it if they have a good education they can get in for free but they have to have good grades. Some students might want to become a teacher but might not have the right education for that so that why education is important.

Second, students could have better job opportunity. Some students would not like the job they get. Also students with good education could give students a job they want. Another thing a better job could make the students get more money from higher paying job and also some students could want to become a teacher. Students also do not have to worry about how much they are getting paid and what type of job they have. Some students could have a better job opportunity if they get an extra 30 minutes because they get more education are more likely to pass their test.

Third, students will be better prepared for test. Some students struggle with a lot of test because they can not stay back. So I think an extra 30 minutes could help students get a little more education and it could help students learn more and be better prepared for test. An also passing test is important because it is one of the highest grade and if u fail them it could make your grade go down a lot. An some student may struggle and that could help student do more activities and maybe they can pass more.

6E8B43214951,"Cell Phones

I think the principle should not allow students to have phones at school at all. I think that is a better decision then allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times. I think that because that may affect the students learning and education. For an example a students was texting another student of something that happened in a different school. Then she told her what happened, but she didn't tell her everything because the student has to go to class now. Today was a really important lesson, but the student didn't pay attention at all because she wanted to know what happened next and she was wandering and dreaming. She didn't pay attention at all and when she took a test the test had some questions that had to do with that lesson, but guess what she failed. The other student was in class when she was texting. She didn't pay attention because she was busy texting and also that affected the other students learning and education and she also failed the test because they also had a really important lesson that they needed to know. That's why its really important to not allow students to bring phones in school at all. Also if the student bring phones to school that also might disturb other students. For an example when you bring your phone to class and you forgot to turn it off then it rings all the sudden. That might disturbed the whole class and also might affect the other students learning. I also think they should put that as a school rule in all schools that ""Phone's are not Allowed to be in School"". Never ever bring your phone to school at all. I think that would be the best policy for all schools.

FA0A22FE957A,"Summer vacation is for enjoyment. Every student is waiting for it. Students need long break to make his/her mind better. In vacation many students go for a trip with family or with friends. In school days students are waiting for vacation but when they have vacation they miss there school friends. Students need break for 4 to 5 weeks to enjoy there vacation.

Some educators students feel that the summer break is too long and they think when they return to school they cannot catch up easily. They said we have a holiday in year-round means only 1 times in a year. It should be only for 3 to 4 weeks as long as a winter break.

I did not agree with the educators students because students have aslo there life. Ther need to enjoy it make a fun and they also have dreams for their life. Educators students cannot decided others life. If they needs short break then they after 3 to 4 weeks they start study at home and fweel like they are doing their school works. Educators did not like long break because in schoolthey always study and at home also. Long break for educators student is like a death. Educators student cannot enjoy their vacation properly because they alway think about there study. I think in vacations all students cannot think about the study. They need to enjoy their vacation . Educators students also have their life and they need to enjoy it properly had a fun, spend time with with famil or friends. Go gor a long trip and refresh there mind. After all that they can start from begining for their study. They get better ideas for study. They study properly without tension.

I suggest educators students and normal students go togather because educators students also have an idea how to enjoy it make it fun and where they want to go. In summer vacation students may go beach, park, sunshine point and enjoy it. In summer vacation students may enjoy ever single movement because it can be there memories.

After then they finish there schools they can missed tht evey single movement that they had a lot of fun on it. They miss theirfiends whom they enjoy. They miss there school. But after their schools they cannot meetv their friends easily because all friends may go somewhere else for their study and for their best future.

CCAAA7CD145E,"The effects that technology has limits human contact and this is not a good thing. The limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has made a negative impact on many people around the world. When technology was not as advanced as it is today, you would see children playing outside. Kids would play with jump ropes,

basketballs , or just spend the day going for a walk or a bike ride. When I was a little kid that was all I wanted to do, go outside and play with my friends. It didnt matter to me if it was snowing or if it was 100 degrees outside i was always ready. However, socializing does not only have a positive effect on children, but one on adults as well. For example, when a parent takes their child to the playground, it allows both the parent and the kid to interact with people,and make new friends, unlike today. In this day and age it is rare to see children playing outside. Many kids these days just sit inside and play Fortnight on their X-Box, or watch t. v all day;which is not an effective way to find new friends or enjoy the world. Some might say playing on your X-Box is a was of socializing because you can communicate with other players, but it is not the best way of making new friends. Another big problem technology has created is social media. Everywhere you go someone is on Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook , Twitter, etc. and I will admit I am one of them, but all these social media apps have driven people apart. In some way these apps can be a fun thing but at the same time a bad one. These apps allow you to post pictures when you travel or when you out getting lunch. But I would say it has more negatives than positives. For example, these apps have made it easier to judge people even if you dont know them, and its like this because the only way of knowing the person is threw their accounts, which is not the right way to get to know someone. Having a face to face conversation with a person is way better then using your phone, iPad or other products because in a way you get closer and get to know the person much better rather than using technology.

60CCF0F2DF38,"Dear Winston Churchill,

I strongly believe that, failure plays a huge role in pursuing success, and I have a personal story and also information to back up my statement ""that failing is the key to success"".

The news article of daily life, had a section dedicated to failing is a key to success, in that portion it talks about how the most successful people in the world had to fail so many times and hardship in that portion of the article it interviews Bill Gates and he quote on quote said that ""failing thought me that you have to try harder and harder every time you fail in order to successed"", and without failing he would not be the CEO of Google.

I personally have experienced how failing is the key to success. I started playing football in my freshman year in high school. I was trying so hard to get a starting position on the football team. I was doing really bad during team practice, and one day my coach came up to me and told me that I should quit football, and how it was not the right sport for me. So I got cut from the team but I did not listen to what my coach said to me. I kept practicing over the off season working harder then ever. When sophomore season came up and we had to go through tryouts in order to make the team. I was doing really good in the first two days of the tryouts but then I started doing really bad on the third day, and then the coach came up to me on the last day of the tryouts, and told me that I did not make the team. I started feeling really hopeless but I still did not gave up and kept working harder and harder. On my junior season it was time for the football tryouts once again. I started doing really good, and the coaches were really impressed of what I was capable of doing. Last day of the tryouts the coach came up to me, and told me that he was really proud of me. He was really surprised that I didnt gave up, and after that he told me I made the team as a starting defensive tackle.

In conclusion this is why I strongly agree that failing is a key to success, without failure we as human beings would not be able to improve in our day to day life. It is because of failing which keeps us successful, and makes us humans work harder for what we want in life.

You are able to work on your own pace,you are also able to balance school,work and spending time with friends and families,and your able to take video conferencing at home.

There are many different schools that can let you take online classes. There students going through family issues at home that they aren't able to attend school regularly.

When having the benefit to take online class at home is working at your own pace. You are working at your own pace to get in done fast or you just like to take your time.

DC5DAF538DF2,"During the World War II, most of the people were influenced by the behavior of the people. For instance, a lot of people choose to follow the anti-Semitic politics of Hitler and the Nazis because they were afraid of the death because the Nazis convinced them to follow them. Indeed, by setting a good example you success to convince them because you use both of the major things to influence, the feelings and the acts. You try to reach his heart by the sensitivity and by the concrete you show him that it is easy to do it. In this way, when you are setting a good example you are using the feelings of the people in order to show them the better behavior to adopt. The fear, the happiness, the solemnity can influence a choice of a person and that is why it is the better way to persuade. Through the fashion, the advertisements, the politics the sensitivity is always utilized to change the mind of someone. The behavior is the only thing that can help someone to change their opinion because trough it you can transmit all of your feelings to your speaker. Furthermore, people can be persuade by acts more easily than by words. So, by setting a good example, you can also influence people by showing them the better way to do something. Although people disagree with philosopher, physician, and humanitarian like Albert Schweitzer and affirm that there are better ways to convince someone, people should consider that to set a good example is the better way to persuade somebody.

Firstly, the behavior is using the feelings to convince people. Indeed, whatever things you do to influence someone you use their feelings. And this is the best way because the feelings are something that stay in your mind and touch you directly and can let you do things even bad. The first example is in politics. A politician who takes a solemn tone and does a serious, and sad speech will influence your opinion and by modifying your state of mind he will transmit these feelings to show you what he wants you to think. Martin Luther King said: ""I have a dream"" so immediately you know that this dream is something anchored in his heart and he will give you all of his arguments to persuade you. Then, the second example is advertisement. As well as the fashion than the TV shows, each publicity lets you feel so be it fear, so be it happiness. They carry away people with them in their opinion and by choosing beautiful musics or pictures they help the spectator to feel the good vibes that the actors or advertising want to give you.

Secondly, by setting a good example you can convince people to do acts. The first reason is people of our generations need to see to trust someone. And this is the reason why you need to show the example to someone to help him to trust you and give him the directions to follow. It was always easier to speak instead of to act but people want to see to know this is the better choice. For example, when you are doing shopping most of the girls prefer doing it in the shop instead of in line because women want to see their clothes to try them and be convinced this dress or this shirt is the better. The other reason is that you always want to have a concrete thing. So when you show the example you demonstrate that what you do is possible and affordable to you all and you encourage them to do it with you and this is what influence others. You give a proof of concrete and the speaker only need a little bit of will. For example during an humanitarian mission, if you are the leader of this one you need to show them the example not only with your behavior but also in what you must accomplish. If you are here to rebuild a public building you will do it with the volunteers to help them and lead the group.

To conclude, the example is the best way to influence people for two reasons. The first one is obviously the aspect of the feelings. The transmission of a posture or opinion can help you to do a choice. The second one is the aspect of the concrete part. You give the example of what to do and the others can do it easily. Finally, there is not better way to convince people as Albert Schweitzer said. Because there is only one way which combines feelings and action and it is the good example by your own behavior.

D0C50EB5CB1F,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow,"" I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson, because he says that if you don't do something you will stay in the same place and never grow up if life, you will not advance, and you conformed with what you have. I believe that peoples always try to overcome in life, that's why you always have to try progress in life and grow up and not be an conformist. because you always can be better in life. We have the ability and the opportunity in our hand.

First , never stay where you are, always try to do something else and try to get more experience, always try to overcome in life,because you can always try to be bigger, and bigger,and try to dominate other things because you have the ability and the opportunity do grow up and never give up easily and if you have the opportunity to grow you will do it because never let opportunity get away from you chase the opportunity to be better and to master other things.

I believe that you always have the ability to chase your dream and if it is not enough you can find more and you can get to your where your limit is. I think that all people have the potential to follow and surpass them abilities and if you already dominated your, you can find and try another one don't stay with the same one because there are always there's a lot of things inside of us that we don't want to take it out of them but if a person take it out he can do things that non one can believed, because it still inside of them you know that you have capacity for that but you don't want to do it.

all people make them own decision but some of them don't know what's them capacity is. Sometimes they don't take the opportunity they just throw it on the trash.

Like the feeling of a person they don't fight fort that they can be a big house a lot of money but they can't feel the love that someone has for them that's the one that a person has to recognize they stay in the same place without doing anything they know that they can change that make that happen. But they can change in like and they can grow up.

As a person we have to respect each other, make decision on life to grow as a person be a good person in the association take care of my and my family respect my family, be respectful with everyone. Be clean be a good person help someone make a man as a person having good attitude be as good person with my mom. If we make be thinking in this life we ave not gonna grow as a person if we are doing something that we are not suppose to. I think

I think that respect is one of the most important part in the world.

ADCF328F2A47,"Security or Freedom

Sometimes to reach something, you have give something else. Security is big trouble that is discuted in all parts of the world, where people live their life with fear, without hope to reach a great future for their next generation. A lot of times, this troubles happen in places where people live under the control of the gangs or another dangerous group. I believe that adopt a curfew to try to protect the life of people on general is a great idea, due the big meaning that this represent in the life.

One of the reasons why this is a great idea is because means more security for people. If the city council adopt this curfew, people could not go around places too late because if they do it, they would be breaking the law. For example: If you are walking alone to home in the night at 9 P.M. you feel scared, now imagine that there is a man on the corner; you do not know if he is a criminal or a normal person, but you are scared , you feel insecure due the presence of that man in that place. Then this adoption look for that reason and prevent a tragedy.

Also, this adoption says that if the curfey is adopted, teenagers on the streets after 10 P.M. on weekdays and midnight on weekends, they would be braking the law. This is another big reason for this adoption, because this means less troubles for teenagers. As we know, a lot of teenagers are influenced by groups of teens to commit wrong actions to integrate in their group. This make that teenagers are involucred in big troubels, that could end in the jail or inclusive dead. This adoption may feels like a big restriction for teenagers, but it is not; the only thing that this look for teenagers is less troubles and more oportunities to be safe.

Additionally, this adoption could mean less crimes in the citiy. Currently, crimes are incresing through the years, making that the people feels without hope to come back home. When we talk about crimes, we are not talking only about deaths; we refers to crimes in general like: vandalism, theft, kidnapping, gangs, etc. If the council approve this adoption, all this troubles will be less trough the time due the strong law that this will mean. Making the place more safe and secure for he habitants.

On the other hand, this adoption could be unfair because although they are not doing anything bad, they are breaking the law. For example: My aunt works in a restaurant, and sometimes she works too late. She does not have car, then she walk to home; she arrives at home at 1 A.M or even 2 A.M. Then if the counsil approves this adoption, she will be affected because although she does not do something bad, she is breaking the law due the job. Futhermore, if you have an emergency and you are alone, you need help; then you go out to look for help. I think this are great arguments against the adoption, but in my opinion its best keep the security for the people.

In conclusion, make this adoption possible is a good way to keep the calm in the habitants of the city.

CCC05B237877,"Your attitude is the best way to achieve your goals or just a plus to get everything easily. In life if your attitude is pleasant you will have a lot of opportunities, and also be succesful in work, love, and friends. For example if you help your partners in work, and do your work well probable your boss prometed you in a better stand for all your effort and devotion. Another example can be in love if you are affectionate, charismatic, and loving probably you gonna find someone love you and give you the same love, and actitud you have with her.

To begin with, the best way to get a best position in your work is to show a good attitude. The majority of contrators like someone everyone loves too, because is more effective to everyone and effective for the company. For example last year in my uncle work someone will be ascent, 3 workers inclued my uncle, the most part vote for him because they said is the most friendly, and the most appropiate for the jod. To conclude this if your attitude like the others everyone wiil be agree with you and they going to follow you because they trust you.

Secondly, the best manner to be in love with your partner is havening a great attitude, and communication. The most part of relationship work, because both respect each other, and have a great communication. For example my Mom and my Dad never fighting they prefer talk and solve them problems and teach me how is not necessary have a load attitude to solve a problem. This show how have a good attitude is the best way to prevent the love gone and preven divorces.

However everyday people say ''he is the president because we need him no because we want he lider us''.

Have you ever though what you can do to stay out of trouble in school? You might always have that one friend that gets introble a lot right? Ways you can prevent that from being you is try to prevent from getting into a fights that would just make it a bad idea, if you know someone that is doing what they are not so post to tell a teacher, dont make a poor choice and you get introble because you decided that you were going to do something that your friends wanted you to do.

When you get into a fight in school the only thing that that will do to you is get you into in school suspension or you would get suspended from school for a while. You dont want to get in school suspended that would just get you in a room with a teacher and you are not going to be able to talk to anyone. If I were you and I knew that some one wants to get into a fight I would ell the teacher and let them handle it not you. Another thing that if you do while there is a fight at your school and you record it you could get in trouble by that as well.

If you know something is wrong with a friend and they need help from an adult I would tell a teacher at school that can help them or there parents if you know them. If you try to help a friend by talking to the person that made your friend feel upset you could feel a friends mom or some adult you know close to your family.

When a teacher give the students summer project desingn by them, the students will feel like they still in school and that will effect students. Summer project should be student-designed because it is their time, they know what a better design for them, and some students like to experience the real world instead of doing project.

It is their time. Summer break is the time for student to do something out of school and to do something students would really like to do. Some students like to play sports like soccer, football, and basketball. Other students like to play video games on the summer break. Summer break for some of students is for them to set a goal like reading a 100 books, visiting 10 new counties, and to learn 100 new words. Summer break is special for students.

They can design what they think is right for them. Each students is different from the other, they have different thing to do and no one will really know them like their friends. Instead of the teacher designing the summer project, the student's friend can design the project for them since they know each other better than everyone else. The student's friend will choose a subject that their friend know a lot about it and love it. Teacher can give the students ideas for the summer project but student can choose them or pick what summer they would like to do.

Some students like to experience something to learn. Some of the students like to experience the thing they are learning about it instead of reading or doing 20 pages of writing. Some students do like to read and write instead of experience it and their friend should know that. Many student are looking for jobs in the summer break so they can make some cash and get experience for the future when they get a job. Experience something can be totally different than reading about it like diving, traveling, and playing sport. Some things are better to experience than reading.

Some people may say teacher should design the summer break project, however; summer project should be student-designed because it is their time, they know what a better design for them, and some students like to experience the real world instead of doing project.

15B68B826F8D,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" He believe people should try to do something new beyond what they already know. Being good at new things can make you feel more confident with yourself. I agree that people should try to do something new beyond what they already mastered because trying to do something new can make you feel more confident and experimenting something new can make you discover more about yourself.

To begin with, trying to do something new can make you feel more confident with yourself. People can be more success in life knowing more things. If people are always scared on doing something else they will not have experiences in life and It can be hard for them to grow. For Example, I was working in a restaurant for so long I really knew how to do that job, but I wanted another job to get more money; however, I was scared on getting a new job, I thought I was not going to be good in at that, then someone told me that I should try that I will never know if I am good at something if I do not try. Now, I working in a new job, I am more confident, and I am one of the best workers in the restaurant. Therefore, If people do not try to do something new because they do not feel like good at that, they will never know if they were one of the best. Growing is part of trying if you failed, then you will learn from your experience.

Second, experimenting something new can make you discover more about yourself. Sometimes you have to let go what you already mastered and start experimenting more about life, so you can not be stack on the same thing. Grow is difficult for the people who do not have experiences in life. For instance, When I came to this country I was so scared on learning a new language and how people will treat me, but start interacting with new people, learning about their countries, and trying different foods. Now, I can say that I have learn so much from other people and I realized that interacting with other people can make me grow in a way that I can feel more confident when I am around people. So, experimenting something else can make people matured and smart as well.

On the other hand, some people say that trying to do something beyond what you already mastered, do not make you grow. They say that people that are good at something should not be evolved in something else because they could get lost knowing different things, but I believe people will never get lost learning new things, learning is the key of growing. For Example, my friend is soccer player he is really good and he started learning to play baseball, he became good at both sports. That shows that people can be good at different things at the same time without lost what they already know. Therefore, trying something new can make you good at different things and discover talents that you did not know that you have.

To conclude, trying to do something else beyond what you already mastered will make you grow. People can discover more about themselves, grow with the experiences on tying to do something, and if they failed they will learn from that. Life give us that opportunity to mastered different things, learning something new make us be more confident and success on life. We should try to do something else maybe we are not good at that, but at least we try to do it and get something with us.

B01DC4B13C31,"No, I don't think students would be benefit to attend classes from home because they don't learn anything, and they will be behind from other students.

Students will not learn anything from online classes because they don't take the online classes seriously, and they won't do the homework that the teacher gives them, and they have to pay for the online classes the online classes are expensive,and that would be waste of money. Some people in the Unite States are poor they can't aafford. they can't achieve thier goals because they have to work and study hard to achieve their goals.

Some might say, attending classes from online will help them to work and earn money because some poeple have to work, they need money to pay rent and other bills; however, they can work part time from after school 4 to 5 hours a day, so they don't get tired, and they can make enought money to pay the rent and other bills.

8C01B86DE888,"Homework Clubs

Imagine getting all of your work completed easily and correct! A homework club are for students that is having a difficult time of getting their work done, they can also do their work together as a class. Homework clubs are good for students because they can finish it early, they can help each other, and it improves their learning skills.

First, students finish early. Students can do something else later instead of homework, and it helps them avoid of getting a late work. For example, back in 7th grade, I didn't really do my homework and I knew that I didn't make the right choice so the consequences were having a bad grade, and being grounded for a long amount of time. I really didn't like doing homework but I learned something from it so I started doing my work since I was grounded.

Second, students can help each other. Students can help the ones that are having a difficult time of doing their homework, they can also finish their work easily. For example, when I stayed after school for my English teacher to do work, I realized that I finished most of my work because I was focused and I asked the teacher multiple times to help me with some of the work. It helped me bring my grades up from a failing to a passing. So I suggest that students should do homework clubs to get their work done.

Third, It improves their learning skills. It improves their collaboration, and it improves their communication skills, and it can improve their skills on every subject. For example, when I was in 4th grade, I didn't know a single word in English so I was in this program called, English and Second Language, where they taught me new words everyday until I started talking English in class and to other students. It helped me came along this far where I didn't need it anymore. I was scared to talk to people because I thought that they would make fun of me because I didn't know how to talk, but I was wrong. I made my first friend in 5th grade and his name was Etka, we were both at the program but he knew a lot more English than me so he also helped me improve my communication skills along the way.

I think that after school homework clubs are good for students because students can finish it early with the help of one another and the teacher. The most important thing about this club is that it improves your learning skills and your communication skills.",Male,8,Asian/Pacific Islander,444,444,438,20,6,73.0,47.43169399,37.16216216,165,444,Independent,Economically disadvantaged,Afterschool homework club,4.0,4.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.5,"homework clubs imagine getting all of your work completed easily and correct! a homework club are for students that is having a difficult time of getting their work done, they can also do their work together as a class. homework clubs are good for students because they can finish it early, they can help each other, and it improves their learning skills. first, students finish early. students can do something else later instead of homework, and it helps them avoid of getting a late work. for example, back in 7th grade, i didn't really do my homework and i knew that i didn't make the right choice so the consequences were having a bad grade, and being grounded for a long amount of time. i really didn't like doing homework but i learned something from it so i started doing my work since i was grounded. second, students can help each other. students can help the ones that are having a difficult time of doing their homework, they can also finish their work easily. for example, when i stayed after school for my english teacher to do work, i realized that i finished most of my work because i was focused and i asked the teacher multiple times to help me with some of the work. it helped me bring my grades up from a failing to a passing. so i suggest that students should do homework clubs to get their work done. third, it improves their learning skills. it improves their collaboration, and it improves their communication skills, and it can improve their skills on every subject. for example, when i was in 4th grade, i didn't know a single word in english so i was in this program called, english and second language, where they taught me new words everyday until i started talking english in class and to other students. it helped me came along this far where i didn't need it anymore. i was scared to talk to people because i thought that they would make fun of me because i didn't know how to talk, but i was wrong. i made my first friend in 5th grade and his name was etka, we were both at the program but he knew a lot more english than me so he also helped me improve my communication skills along the way. i think that after school homework clubs are good for students because students can finish it early with the help of one another and the teacher. the most important thing about this club is that it improves your learning skills and your communication skills.",6

Most of the students prefer online classes because they can't get transportation from home to class. Video conferencing and online classes would benfit students in a way that their will be less distraction and work in your own level. Society now in days has many bullies in school that it comes to the point that studuents don't want to come to school and prefer taking class at home by there self.

For example I had a cousin that took online class at home because he had no transportation to get to school. He was able to benefit better at home because even when he was sick he would still be able to accomplish his work. Most of the teenagers want to go to school but they can't because they have no way to get to school. Online classes and Video conferencing is way were students can get education and graduate without leaving their house.

you won't have to worry about getting bullied at home if you take classes at home, you will get less distraction, and you will work in your own level taking classes at home.

E0553AEE109E,"Most students enjoy having a long summer vacation, but others prefer it not to be so long. Schools usually do three months for a summer break, but people argue that there should only be a month of summer break. Also have a longer winter break and a week off in the spring and fall. I do not think this is a good idea. Even though, when it is time to come back to school students will have forgotten everything, it is nice to have a long summer break because people go on vacation a lot, students can have an opportunity to work full time, and reduces stress for students.

Educators should have a long summer break because people go on vacation a lot to see long distance relatives, or to just spend some quality time with family and have fun. For example, if you live in Virginia it will be a long car ride to make it to Florida or any other place. You will need a long break to plan your trip and have enough time to stay at any place you will go. Other people do not necesarily go on trips to just see family maybe it is a gift or a tradition that families have. Having time is the most important thing when it comes to going on a vacation.

Another reason why it is a necesity for students to have a long summer break is because most students will get to work full time and make more money of their own. Most parents like their child to learn how real life is and what struggles you have to got through to get the things you want. Being a teenager will make you want more things it is the age you will start to drive and experience new things. For example, you will get to the age of driving and you will ask your parents for a car. You will need to earn some money to help your parents out they might give you an estimate amount of how much they can give you, but if that is not enough for you then you need to find a job to get to where you want to be at. If you have a part time job you will eventually get to where you want to be, but it will take longer that is why having a full time job will be easier to get there. To have a full time job it means summer break needs to be longer.

Finally, my last reason why summer should be long for students is because it reduces stress for students. Being in school all year is hard for most students because sometimes is not just school what you have to deal with it can be things going on at home. Having to deal with both is difficult, so it is nice to have a long summer break to get a break from things. For example, if you keep failing tests it might be because you can not manage to study at home. After failing tests, having bad grades, your parents yelling at you for it, pressuring you to do better, and having other things to deal with that will make you have stress. It is important for students to be able to have a long summer break so they can get their minds off in a lot things and have less stress.

Overall, having a long summer break means people will run out of things to do there should still be a long break because people go on vacations a lot, students can have an opportunity to work full time, and it reduces stress for students. A long summer break means more fun and less stress. Most schools have three months of a break and people are used to having a three month long summer break, so there will be a lot of arguments into why change it now. It is best to just keep it the way it has always been. Having long summer breaks also results in a lot of solutions for people.

E24ADB91F6D3,"I wrote a prompt to determine one thta people made bullyng to, it is really wonderful how people change when they know you, I did a lot to try to be fine with other people's,but not everybody is nice there are still some people to make bullyng or watever to you, they just don't try to meet the people they just perjudice the people without knowing them that's why i am always alone because to much people talk a lot of someone and i really don't like that the people be talking things about others and that the people that are the one's that are threat with bullyng they don't even say anithing of sacared of those people they think they can make bullyng to them.

I always try not to take care of what other people say they can talk whatever they want is their problem but when someone come's and they don't like that they can get hurt and there is when they look for you when they are in trouble, when i am angry or sad i just like to play soccer because that helps me to forget the problemsm that i got in my mind, if could it do something.

i would it try to make games of soccer so all the people that want to play soccer can get to do it and they can forgot their problems too. that's why sports are made because people can have fun without fight, and one more thing it can be is to go with friends to see movies or to watch soccer games or basket ball games or volleyball i don't know but there are a lot of ways to get to know someone, in my way i think that everything got a solution for the problems the problem is that we don't our respect to other people if we do it everthing it would be really different

Everything that we want is to be safe in a place where no gangstars are bbecause they only know how to make peolpe get more poor of what they are we should get involve all the families to try to destroy the people that are hurting others, alot of people try to study their best to be someone in their life they just want to get out their families out of trouble, out of bad ways, they can make alot of money easier when they finished ther school, only with high school finish you can get a nice job not a job that you would like it but you can get at least something.

People can be safe having their things like if someone try to take all that you had they just can go the police and tell them what happens and they might help them and they might help to try to recover what they lose people shouldn't be scared because when they show that they are scared other people can be smart and do a lot of things to thm just because they show sacared and all that we are people really smart but we sould be smart in everything because not because we are smart in some things it means that other people can be nice with you if you don't show angrily other people angry can hurt you in one way that it's going to hurt you a lot.

All people are nice but when they get angry or mad they change a lot they can be reall angry and you can be scared of how they can get, but for not having problems with someone you should just invite them to play sports somewhere or to have fun with your friends you'll can go to the beach and have a lot of fun there so the people can not get angry and it can get to be your friends forever or at least only friends, but no one should show their debil point because when you get a problem with your friends they would aready know what's the point that you would mostly hurt that's hy i think no one should know the most imporant debil point of your body or of you so this is my prompt thanks                                                   ",Male,10,Hispanic/Latino,1909,724,706,6,6,117.6666667,39.64592827,27.3480663,198,724,Independent,Economically disadvantaged,Being busy,3.0,2.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,"i wrote a prompt to determine one thta people made bullyng to, it is really wonderful how people change when they know you, i did a lot to try to be fine with other people's,but not everybody is nice there are still some people to make bullyng or watever to you, they just don't try to meet the people they just perjudice the people without knowing them that's why i am always alone because to much people talk a lot of someone and i really don't like that the people be talking things about others and that the people that are the one's that are threat with bullyng they don't even say anithing of sacared of those people they think they can make bullyng to them. i always try not to take care of what other people say they can talk whatever they want is their problem but when someone come's and they don't like that they can get hurt and there is when they look for you when they are in trouble, when i am angry or sad i just like to play soccer because that helps me to forget the problemsm that i got in my mind, if could it do something. i would it try to make games of soccer so all the people that want to play soccer can get to do it and they can forgot their problems too. that's why sports are made because people can have fun without fight, and one more thing it can be is to go with friends to see movies or to watch soccer games or basket ball games or volleyball i don't know but there are a lot of ways to get to know someone, in my way i think that everything got a solution for the problems the problem is that we don't our respect to other people if we do it everthing it would be really different everything that we want is to be safe in a place where no gangstars are bbecause they only know how to make peolpe get more poor of what they are we should get involve all the families to try to destroy the people that are hurting others, alot of people try to study their best to be someone in their life they just want to get out their families out of trouble, out of bad ways, they can make alot of money easier when they finished ther school, only with high school finish you can get a nice job not a job that you would like it but you can get at least something. people can be safe having their things like if someone try to take all that you had they just can go the police and tell them what happens and they might help them and they might help to try to recover what they lose people shouldn't be scared because when they show that they are scared other people can be smart and do a lot of things to thm just because they show sacared and all that we are people really smart but we sould be smart in everything because not because we are smart in some things it means that other people can be nice with you if you don't show angrily other people angry can hurt you in one way that it's going to hurt you a lot. all people are nice but when they get angry or mad they change a lot they can be reall angry and you can be scared of how they can get, but for not having problems with someone you should just invite them to play sports somewhere or to have fun with your friends you'll can go to the beach and have a lot of fun there so the people can not get angry and it can get to be your friends forever or at least only friends, but no one should show their debil point because when you get a problem with your friends they would aready know what's the point that you would mostly hurt that's hy i think no one should know the most imporant debil point of your body or of you so this is my prompt thanks",4

I used to just like the sport, but my love for it was starting to fade away, until I heard about the basketball legend Kobe Bryant. Because of Kobe Bryant, I fell love with the sport. Not only basketball was my life, I now loved everything about it the smell of the ball, the sound of the dribble, and the smooth leather of the ball. I've drawn a lot from Kobe's game and his of the court experiences. Now I try to influence younger kids to work on their craft.

Regretting something at the end is one of the worse things ever. If you followed someone else's dream, passion, or footsteps without realizing what you are doing is wrong.

60F1B5FB0CDC,"People have the right to make their own decisions in life. No matter how dangerous it could be or how much trouble any person could be in, we are the ones to make the decision of doing something to change the future, we make that decision to try new things every day even if we end up learning from our mistakes. When we make mistakes sometimes it could lead to a beginning to a new start or other times it can lead to something bad, but we always learn from our mistakes.

People all around the world make decisions that are not the best but you get to learn from you mistakes. Experts, authorities, doctors, teachers, lawyers, judges, priest, probably even the president, but each and every one of these people that has had a degree of done good in school have made mistakes all the time. Even if its something you might learn from people still makes mistakes and nobody is perfect, no one can be perfect to the point that never in there lives had they ever made mistakes because majority of the people around the world has made at least more then one mistake and sometimes people dont relies that they have made them. For example Doctors can make the mistake of diagnosing the wrong patient, yes its risky and dangerous but you learn from your mistakes even if there consequences at the end. Lawyers can make the mistake of accusing an innocent person during court, yes people can be innocent before proven guilty but what if they were scared to say the truth and turns out they really are innocent. people make mistakes all the time some can be for poor decision making but you still learn from everything you do.

The reason why people make their own decisions and not authorities it because some people hate having some one to tell them what to do and that is not a hypotheses that is a fact, people genially like doing whatever they want even if its harmful or smart but we end up learning the hard way about everything. People all around the world have a chance to have the decision to change the future for themselves or for their country, some people have the right to be able to save lives with some of the decisions people make. others can have the decision to help the homeless or be foster parents to help children or anyone out. Some decision can be for good use and others can be for greed, revenge, mistakes, or just a bad decision that could get you in some consequences. Everyday people make decisions even if there small decisions. Mistakes can happen all the time but its on the person if they want tot learn from their mistakes or not.

Life is not easy because you have lots of decisions to make everyday with not always knowing the outcome of that decision. Some people have it easy at life because of there decisions and others have it really ruff, experts may or may not understand what someone is going through because they have never experienced it. People make their decisions for so many reasons. For example a man might be going through stage three cancer and just wants people to understand that this is it, no more making decisions because he just wants to go, experts would have probably said take the treatment and be there with your family but it is not the families, friends, experts, doctors decision its the mans decision and his wishes. Experts do not have the right to make our decisions in life because our decisions that we make as an individual person are unique in our own way, people may judge, consequences may happen but it is you making the decision of thinking about what you feel is best for you even if you want make bad ones.

2960E9477338,"In this world there are two different types of people; people who value self-reliance, and people who much rather seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters. People who value self-reliance make their own decisions, they define it as the need for them to follow their own instincts and ideas. When there's a problem, they find a way to fix it on their own with no one elses' help. However, there are other's who need guidance and seek help from experts.

For this particular issue I'm going to have to side with self-reliance. I believe that in order for you to grow as a person, you're going to have to learn how to make your own proper decisions with out anyone's help. Facing problems on your own can lead to many great things. It makes you feel very confident, as if you can overcome any obstacle in life. In other words, it determines how strong you are and shows you that you can handle more than you think.

You may go to an expert about life's important matters and talk about the situation you're in, but really, they don't know you or your story. An expert can easily brainwash you and change your mind about a lot of things with a simple opinion they may have. In several occasions, people already know how to solve their problems, but they need assurance of what the right thing to do is, so they go to experts to find the answer. Really, an expert doesn't know what's best for you, only you do.

There are multiple people that suffer from depression and feel like they need an expert to guide them, they need somone to talk to and to make them feel better. The thing is, why waste money for a complete stranger to talk to you ? Don't get me wrong, It's great to express your feelings and let things out when you feel the need to. When you need guidance, the right people to go to is family and friends because they know you and what's best for you.

In my personal opinion, valuing self-aliance is the greatest thing you can do. You should make your own decisions, you shouldn't pay someone to do it for you. Seeking guidance from an expert is just a waste of money and time. At the end of the day only you know what's best for you and can rely on yourself only.

0C7D385D812A,"How should people take decisions?? thats the real question should a person follow a feeling or motion call instincts or should they make a decision by guidance by experts and the laws and authorities. Well a person should use advise really. For example lets say a business man has to make a decision about if he should invest money or not on a product thats been selling good for the last few months but in the pass they werent selling as much. so the business man has to go and get guidance with some experts because he doesnt want to make the wrong decision and make the company waste money they wont get back.

Thats why having advisers are so helpful because there suppose to help people get out of any concerns a person has. They can guide and advice you to do things right. For example when a person is in high school that person has a guidance. That person is always going to be trying to help, there gonna help decide which classes are best for a student, and there gonna look in to the student and check why a student isnt doing good and after that there gonna try to help him so he can accomplish hes goals and graduate.

Every time we take a decision over something serious we need to think about it more than once because if it is a decision like buying a house its life changing ether it can go really good or it can hurt you badly thats why its better to think about it and talk with an expert because its needed to know if that person is ready and its stable enough. For example if a person wants to buy a house theres a lot of responsibilities that come with that decision and he or she has to be ready that means theres no more playing around and settle down and he or she needs to think about it if thats what they really want.

Take decisions it always has a grade of difficulty thats sometimes not even with the best advisers can help to make a decision being one hundred percent sure that thats the right answer. Sometimes you just have to trust youre instincts because a person has knowledge about the answer to the question but he or she think about the answer to much that they get them selves confused and thanks to that they make poor choices when really you should just trust the person is right. For example when a teacher tells a student on a test trust your instincts and dont think about the answer to much is because they know that he knows the answer.

In conclusion its always better to have a person giving you advise about a question or problem, its easier to make good decisions when a person has help than when a person is alone confused and stress about a decision. But at the same time is good to trust your self and follow your instincts and not having to depend or need someones help.

People can checkout books, shop, and play games without speaking to another person.

Has the limitation of human concact due to the use of technology had positive or negative effects on people's lives?

Towards to technology, lack of communication is going to ruin our human sociaty.

Especially when phones are advancing in the next years.

One day, technology will take over the human population.

Say this, one day a boy meets this girl from school and they were talking through a social media,

but one day, they thought to meet up in person and when they saw each other, it was really awkward at first, but then they became very good friends. So they started to go to the movies, the mall, restuarants, and etc.

They started as two random strangers to having a, boyfriend and girlfriend relationship. Saying this to someone is really touching, because liking someone is to die for, but there's rules to follow and things to do and not just kissing or making love, its being there for them and hopefully you'll be there too.

Meeting that special person is a blessing, because for so long people have been trying to talk to this special someone,

but its really hard to confess it through person, but throught a screen is pretty easy, but do you really mean it?

Saying ""I love you"" means alot to someone, but actually saying it over and over again, it just warms my heart to say this, but i think im in love. Not just saying to make people to break through a screen, because saying ""i wanna break up"" it really just says you do not have the heart to say it to their face. Honestly everyone who does this, should just atleast try it and see what's more than life, then just being on the phone most of the day.

Once the day comes everyone will just destroy their own phone to prevent from robot abomination.

EB8030177678,"As Thomas Jefferson said ""Determine never to be idle ... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" I believe that Thomas Jefferson's quote is right because if people determine to never be idle, they can accomplish more than those who determine to be idle. Although some says that determine to be idle or inactivity also serve a purpose because they can accomplish something with the time or when people make a purpose to don't be idle, actually Determine never to be idle is much better because we accomplish more if we are doing something people can make proud their family and people may growth having a better future.

Although some says that determine to be idle or inactivity also serve a purpose in the way of one day they will accomplish something even though they are lazy, and people determine to not be idle when they want to accomplish something and when people decide to not being wasting their time without doing anything, inactivity doesn't serve a purpose in the life and in the way of accomplish something

Determine never to be idle is much better because we accomplish more, we make proud our family when we do something great to our life, I have done many things in school and accomplish many goals in my life so my parents always tell me that I make them feel proud of me for all that I have been done even though they said that it is not that easy but they know that I never determine to be idle and I always like to accomplish something in my life.

I always like to accomplish things like having a better grades in school and learn more each day even though some classes are harder than other once but I like to not be idle because if I determine to be idle I may just waste my time doing nothing.

Determine never to be idle is much better because people can growth having a better future in their life,

people can growth having a better job. For example, I want to growth by studying a career and have a better job in the future.

Is a good benefit because is a easy way to do it, easy and fast and is good too because sometimes some days is snowing and when is snowing all school are closed. And they close the school because the students can not trasportate to the like that because the streets are freeze and really complicate to transport to the school.

If i have to take classes on online or video chat i will because more easy for me and is not difficult to learn on online or video chat. And because i can have more free time i can do more things and i can have a job.

And think too for some student is not good because they dont have the opportunity to have a computer t do they classes online or they dont have internet is difficult for them. Is a good option online classes but not for all students some of them are benefit and some of them dot.

Only classes are a good reason to use because is a good way to cominitate in a long distance, but Free online schools, have to be free all schools online for all students they dont have to pay nothing.

22CFD6C961E3,"Some school districts allowing there students to graduate in 3 years instead of the traditional 4 year is something I strongly consider, and surely something I think we all also have to consider. Being able to graduate in 3 years not only gives you an extra year, but also gives you the proper amount of time to plan your future. The amount of time that you would be spending in school would be a year less.

Given a year, it is up to you, how you use it and what your going to do with it. Getting a job would help save you a lot of money for college. Having a year off doesnt exactly mean that you have to go to school, but instead getting a job will be very beneficial. Whether its to support your family, save money for school, or even for pocket money, knowing that you have not only time, but also extra money, will help you realize that there isnt much to stress about. Jobs also dont have to be something that is outside of school. Having a job that is academic wise or just something temporary to have the experience, will help open you up to more opportunities. Whether you are looking forward to go to college or to become more appealing to bigger organizations/ companies in your work force, having a job that is academic base will help. For example, going to coach my brothers soccer game during the weekends compared to going to a community center to fix computers during the weekends, wouldnt really open me up to more work opportunities rather than fixing computers at a community center will.

Going to college isnt for everyone, but for many is the way to go. Maybe your going for your Masters or even a PHD, when you have a year you are saving the amount of extra time that you would be spending in school. Lets say for my PHD I would have to stay in school for 8 years, knowing that I have saved my self a year even though it doesnt seem like much compared to 8 years is not only saving time and money, but also saving a year to your age. Most student that go for the traditional 4 years typically are being rushed and become stressed out by the end. Colleges will also see that you have graduated showing them your were willing to work hard to get that extra year.

Being able to graduate in 3 years doesnt only ask for patients but also for your dedication. Although you are graduating a year early, it doesnt neccisarly mean that the work load given in that year doesnt have to concern you. You would have to be able to manage your time and work hard to makeup for that year, yes, even if it means you have to give your summer break. Staying organized and knowing what your aim is, will give you more confidence making you become dedicated.

Although some may argue that this is definitely something stressful and given 3 years is not enough for the workload in high-school, just know there is still hope. There are some student that dont have enough time to even finish in 4 years. So being thankful, you should know that it is alright if you cant finish in 3 years. Having this program gives opportunities to student but also saves time. School districts should label the students that have enough credits to graduate and for those that don't, and for those that dont, they should offer support (programs/ clubs) for them to possibly graduate in 3 years.

3E6C6F1FE64D,"Imagine going to school and it's your first day back from summer vacation and you walk into class with a weird impression that some teachers want to change because they know you can change the way you act or talk to other people. I think first impressions can be change because there are people that struggle to show how they feel so they have this mean impression towards people the cause of it might be parents divorce a lot and a family member passing. Some resources say that 50 percent of the population tend to give students or parents an impression that is either showing how they feel towards something.

Firstly, changing an impression might be a challenge for some people but they said its impossible to change in my reasoning I think it's possible to change someones first impression. You really can't give someone an impression if you don't know anything about them or if you don't know them. You can't always say ""oh their so mean"" until they know your background. The reason I say that is because most of the time it's true most people would give an impression towards new students at school, but they don't know anything about the person. In reality, I disagree with first impressions are almost impossible to change because you can change that impression that people tend to have on there face.

Secondly, there are other ways you can show your impressions if you don't want to show them. The first one is that you need to try to befriend them and make a conversation you never know you and that person might have a lot in common that you just didn't know to begin with. Your impression doesn't judge but it's the way you show it because sometimes it led to making new friends, having good grades, and making your own decisions in life sometimes.

Thirdly, I think impressions can change because nobody said anything about ""anything isn't impossible "" but a lot of stuff is possible if you believe there is. My reasoning to this prompt is that if you don't try hard enough to change the impression you have on your face then how can you make friends or how can you ignore what people are saying about you . Everyone can change especially their impressions you just keep trying and get to know the person.

In conclusion, I think first impressions can be change if you act right towards people and how you treat others with your impression. Nothing is impossible if your don't try to change it or if you don't try to make a way to get people to be on the same level as you in the end. So I totally disagree with this prompt for saying that first impressions are almost impossible to change.

70D0DC705643,"There are some students that have the time to stay after school and finish their work, on the other hand, their are other students that don't have the time. Some students hate to be at school in the afternoon because they think it's boring and there is nothing to do in it. They think it's a waste of their time and they don't want to go. So, there should be no after school homework club because students probably have something to do after school or they just hate staying at school for another hour.

Student usually have something to do in the afternoon like go to a sport practice, have a emergency and has to go to the hospital, and more. Usually, they have more time in the class to finish their work if they finish early. If they don't finish early, then they have the next day to work on it. But, if the students didn't finish the next day, then the teacher will let him finish another day or for homework. So, the students still have time to go to their practice or other important things.

Just like students have something to do after school, they don't like to stay after school either. Usually, the students are sitting around waiting for the clock to hit the dismissal time because they want to go home already. Students get bored in class of listening to a teacher voice, and talking about whatever they are learning about in that class. Students wants to hang out with friend after school, or wants to get ready ready for a vacation, so they have to do it in the afternoon where they have time to do get ready.

I think it is a bad idea to make a after school homework club because the school tells you where to do your homework or regular work and that is at home or do it the next day.

55A31DF14015,"Today's news is that some school districts offer programs that allow students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. It would not be a good idea if students graduated one year early to enter college and the work force in my opinion, because students would have less education and not be able to take elective courses that they might need. For example, if students leave one year early from high school then,they might have a hard time when needed some might just do fine out there in the world.

Students that graduate school one year early will probably be six-teen or seven teen of age when entering college and the work force but, have a hard time when applying for a job in an office and not get accepted because they are to young to work there. The students would also have less time to figure out what career they would like to have and also no one would want to take courses during the summer time or in the evenings.

On the other hand, its best if all the students finish high school in four years instead so when they graduate they'll be eight-teen or nine-teen they will have time to think about what career they want and check out what colleges they want to addend after high school they will also be able to take the elective courses that could help after high school. While being a high school students could get a part-time job after school maybe getting into after school clubs they might enjoy with their friends. They will also have learned how to be more responsible not act like little kids anymore,be more like adults being on time, respect others, have a positive adittued in school and at work.

Students would be able to attend field trips with other students that are interested in going to college for example, like career day students would go to panels asking question to adults about their jobs and that can give them an idea of what career they would want, passion it about,and what they would find interesting. Not everyone knows what they want to do after high school some might still take their time and figure it out freshmen year of college.

0F1285CEAE53,"Everyone knows that, some people have experience in what they do. But sometimes those persons does not feel sure in their skills. Persons with talent are in everywhere. As soon as, they know their limit of work. Having experience is a good signal for the person to continue. Ralph Emerson is a famous writer. He wrote a saying that make you think about growing. The reason of grow is because the person get experience in their work. I agree with that Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered you will never grow. The person never grow when is doing something that already have a mastered because the person already have experience, do not need to do it again and never know that already have it done.

To begin, the person already have experience. With the experience the person can advance in their work. The person can look for a good position in their job because of the expereince the person gain of working hard. There is no need to do something that the person already did. The negative mind brings someone to think that they can't do it and they keep trying. Even thought they have already mastered. With this experience the person can use for teach someone, to share and then keep going. So, learn something new. When a student ask you for help in Science and you had A last year in that class because you have alredy mastered. The person decide to share and help the student teching by the knowledge and experiences of the person have.

Moreover, the person do not need to do it again. That means the person already did it. The persons do not grow when they still doing the same thing. The lack of their believes is a hard rock to pass. That means firsly, they need to start believe in their skills and they will get an amazing result of their work. The experience is just a step for the person to keep going and don't stay in the same problem or place. Do things that already have mastered is boring for some persons. If the person learn something new in class than, the person can continue with another topic. Don't do it again because the person is not going anywhere. The student did a test and this have a B+ in the grade book. But the student is not happy because doesn't have exactly an A. The student decide to retake the test because he thinks that can have an A. It is not good for the student because not everyone has to get A in the grade book even though B+ is a very good grade and there's no need to do the test again.

Lastly, never know that the person have it done. If the person does not know when they finished then, they will get a bad result. They need to know when they finished their goal for not keep going. Have a mental carefull in what the person is doing one of the most important thing. As soon as, they know the truth of the person's experience it may the person grow. Look at the life cycle the things never stop growing. So, the person have the same path to follow. Do something that you have already mastered, don't make the person grow. Simple, the person do their work, get experienced, finished and keep going. An student that likes to do everything with details and want to get an excellent grade have a project. The project is to talk just about the two strand in DNA. The students have the option of write an essay or present inslides by doing it in PowerPoint. The student decide to wrote an essay everything was good in the essay. But the student decide to do the project in slides too. So, the student present both to the teacher by the due date. By the end of the semestre the student look the grade book and check the grade of the project. The student have an D because the student turn the two ways to turn in the project. When just the essay was enogh.

In conclusion, if the person continue doing the same thing that have already mastered, the person never grow up. The person need to be positive and know well the experience of the person have. Follow the life cycle. Don't stop and continue working hard. Have experience, the mind of not keep doing the same and don't know when the person have it done.

E19CE100743C,"""Getting something by doing something or doing nothing also bring us something""

We accomplish more if we are always doing something ,because if we do more than what we want or have we will always be growing ,everytime that we do something no matter what it's we receive something back ,many people called ''reward"" , when we want something and we work hard to get that, we create a confidence in ourself's that we now that by doing something we can get what we want and we motivate ourself to accomplish that. we get more if we do more ,but some people think that by doing nothing you can get something back . accomplishment is something that you get by working hard , giving your best ,and by doing something about it , if we dont do anything we aren't going to accomplish anything or get anything in this life .

We accomplish more by doing something, because if we do more than what we want or have we will always be growing more. like one time I remember that I was in six grade and I really wanted to participate in the math competition that Generic_Name prepare every year ,only the fastest student's in math can participate ,so Generic_Name tell us that they were math reviews after school to practice for the competition ,but I didn't have the opportunity to stay in does reviews ,because every day in the after school I had swimming practice and I couldn't skip because my classes were already paid , so I remember that I was sad and I start thinking that if I really wanted to be in that competition I should do something to be there ,I start to wake up two hours early in the morning and I would practice math and also I will go to the library in lunch to work on math exercises ,but that sacrifice was worth it because when Generic_Name make the list for the people that would be able to participate in the competition my name was there. My mom always tell me that no matter how many times you fail in getting something , because the next time that you tried you wouldn't do the same mistake twice and at the end because of your effort and hard work you will accomplish everything that you want to make in your life. that's something I will remeber the rest of my life.

We get more by doing more ,because every single time that we do something ,no matter what it's we are going to get something back ''recompense''. when you take your time to do something with patience , will ,and gratitude that can benefit other people by not expecting something back ,we have that selfsatisfaction of making someone happy. like when you see a poor child walking in the streets ,looking for food in the trash ,bacause he is hungry and he doesn't have money to buy some food or maybe he doesn't have a mom that can feed him and you know that you can make that kid happy by giving him some food , because you have that feeling of helping him and make him happy once. one time I remember that I went with my mom to work , we went to clean a house of a 79 year old woman that the only company that she had was her dog , so I remember that I ask my mom if I can come the weekends to her house and join her during the day , and I didn't know that this woman would became someone special for me. she was very sweet ,kind , and lovely woman that i have ever meet in my life , she use to call me grandaugther and I was so happy to get the opportunity to meet her and when the time pass; her son that lives in Generic_City came to country and decide to take her with him and when the moment to say good bye comes, I was really sad because I would not be able to see her again ,but after she left I would always remember the words that she tell me; ""I'm living ,but dont worry because you would always be in my heart ,and i will always have in present everytime that you spend with me and make me happy."" that day I learn that when you do something no matter what it is you will always receive something back and that something it can change your life forever.

We get more by doing something ,because if we want something and we work hard to get what we want , we create a confidence of ourself, that we know that no matter how hard we have to work to accomplish that ,if we put our effort we can get what we want. like when you are at school and you have alot of assigments to do ,but you still motivate yourself to complete everything that you have to get done and you make the effort to continue until you are done, that's when you realize that you have that confidence of knowing that "" if you purpose yourself you can do everything "". confidence is something that is going to help you in every situation that you are in , it would help you when you are struggleling to take a important decision that maybe it can change your life. I remember when my sister was confused , because she didn't know if she would be able to accomplish the career that she wanted to take in college, and since that day I admire her ,because she believe herself ,she take the career and I knew that she knew that confidence help her to continue fordward and to accomplish what she already know that she wanted ,but at the same time she was scared of taking the challenge and fail. Sometimes we have to take that fear of failling out of our lifes ,and bring that confidence that would help us to belived in ourself's.

Getting more by doing something, is better than don't do anything expecting that we are going to get something.

By doing something we will always be growing more than what we are , we would always receive something back and that can be the happiness of another person's , and we would have that confidence to believed in ourself knowing that we can do everything that we want if we work hard for it.

That still did not ruined his day. I was like nothing could ruin his day. At lunch he was smiling like a bright star the lunch lady was so happy with the way he smiled. Everywhere he go people liked his attitude, because he had good attitude i surprised him with a present. I knew my since I was three years old.

One day I had a good attitude,that was the day me and my parents went to New York for a vacation.

After we left New York we came back to Virginia I asked my dad if we could go to Virginia beach he said tomorrow. I hope tomorrow i will have a good attitude like i did today.

Today my little brother had a good attitude he was having fun at school and at church at school he passed his science quiz. But at school he got in trouble for talking, that did not stop him form his good attitude. He got a report home from school my parents told him stop talking at school. The next day he still had a good attitude he went to my teacher and told her he was sorry for talking. The teacher accepted his apology and moved on with their day.

Today my best friend had a good attitude. She is always in a bad mood so it is fun to see her in a good attitude. That day she didn't have money in her school lunch account so since she was in a good attitude I gave some money. On that day she invited me to come over to her house to hang out. We had a fun time together.

It wouldnt be fair to the kids or teachers because They will be overloading with thinking, The teachers would get to stressed out, The kids would be annoyed because they wont have any breaks or any think time or even be able to have fun with anything else.

The next reason I think they shouldnt add an hour and a half is because it'll be to late after school to do anything else, For elementry school it'll be ok,

but for Middle school and high school it'll be to late and it'll be at least 6:30 or 7:00 before they get home. With sports after school it'll be even later before they can go home and they wont have time for anything else.

The last reason is Because it'll mess up all there planns .

Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Some people think it is good idea to take classes online. They say they have more time to do they homework. Some people think that take classes online is more easy than going to school. But I think that is more difficult because nobody explain you the thing. If people take classes online they will be not learning nothing. In my opinion it's not good idea because people need help from teachers, some people like to come to school, and they like to distract at school.

Some people like to do they work by they self, but others people need help from teachers. For example my sister always stay after school for help from teachers. She said that they help her with the things she do not know about her classes. She said that she learn too much about her teachers, and she like to come to school because the teachers explain the work. For example when she fail a test she stay after school with the teacher, they review about the test, and she learn more. The teachers find the way to help students after school. The teachers have others things to do but they don't care because they want the students to pass their classes.

Some students like to come to school because they make friends and have fun. For example my brother Generic_Name like to play sports at school. He said that play at school it's fun because he talk with other people. School it's important because we have to know about other people and learn more about what is hapen at school. People have the opportunity to come to school everyday and learn. However, In my opinion is important to come to school because when you graduate you going to be happy with your diploma.

Others might say that classes online is good because they like to work lonely. The school distract people from their houses. Some people need distract and also need socialism with friends. At school is the place that people like and feel safe. For example my friend say that she get distract in school she play a sport, or do a activity with others friends. Also the best way to get distract is to speak with adults people that know more about life. Also distract is doing your homework and listen to music.

In conclution, the teachers help students and they explain the things that the students do not know and online they have to do by they self. Come to school is the best way to learn what you want with your life and want you want to became in your future. School have many distract like games, books that you can read and take home. I think students should come to school and not take classes online. The teachers are the best because they help to much the students. Also they are good persons because explain when you don't know nothing.

Sometime the mom/dad dose not help the student but most of the time the student want to do home school and want to pass then yes it depends on the student. when any student dose school at home they will often not do the work they aslo dont learn all the things the the school teaches they learn what the mom/dad knows.

E22F1FD54169,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson Wrote,""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.""I disagree with The Author Ralph Waldo Emerson because if you have already try to do something more than you have already mastered,

You will grow because now days there is too much competition in everything for examples Companies,Schools and Sports etc. I think if you try to do something more than you have mastered will make you more better than you are because if you have mastered in something it will not be a bad idea to practice more even you know everything because everyday somebody is getting good by watching people those have mastered everything so when they go against them they will beat the master because they already know whats the master is going to do and they will try to protect themselves. Here are some examples when people play video games like fortnite people be watching streamers from YouTube and twitch to get better and learn some new moves and after watching them for some weeks they know what they are going to do next and how they going to play at any bad or good situation

Here are some example like Apple is big company and Samsung is a big company they both have some bad relationships like Apple always make a good phone which is always better than Samsung but Samsung try their best to make a better phone than Apple so, Samsung has been trying to make better phones then Apple by trying to copy their features for examples the screen size, The GB, and motherboards. only reason Apple is making better phones because they have mastered everything and they are still making some new technology which Samsung might not able to make in next two or three years and here is a another example they are so many cars in the world for example Mercedes and Lamborghini they both are good cars Mercedes is a old company so they know everything about the car the way the want to make it luxury or fast and for example Mercedes is a fast and a luxury car where Lamborghini is a fast and luxury car,

Here is a last example like your coach if you play sports you need a coach which is going to teach you how to play and teach some moves that you can use to beat your enemy and make you strong and tell how to dodge some stuff when they try to hit you for example people play boxing and for new people they hires coaches which help them to learn how to play and stuff. and teach you how to defend your self from getting hit on your face or hitting him back.

14ED79D68BC4,"I think if we never try something new we will never are going to grow more. I'm agree with

Emerson's because in this life the point is to try new ideas new experiences is not only stay in one place like if I already have something why can't try something different if I can move more far than where I am for example if I never try something that I always have wanted how am going to know what it's feel. One reason if I already have a mastered in something how im supossively to grow if I never have try it before how I will know if I am good for it Ifor not

I never try before.

Example If I am a person who has a mastered in bussines and I am able to have my own company but Iam scared to try how I am supposively to grow If I don't try I will stay in the same place where I srtart because is does not matter what I am mastered fpr it if I don't try I f I don't take the risk if I am not confident in my self. Unless I try to do something that I already have mastered I will never grow. I think everything depends in our own personallity because there are person that they are already old but some times they regret their selfs because they never try somethint that they could try it when they were young but now is to late for them I think those kind of things are important in life is not only a bachilletor degree is what you want in life is something that if you don't try is gonna stay in our lives forever and we wiil never are going to see that.

Another example for this is that we always have to go beyond that what we already know we never can stop in one place we need to keep going because there are more things to discovered and the more fast we are moving the more fast we start growing it. So every time we need to keep in mind that everything that we do is what is going to make us to look different then others and always be beyond in everything.

First it helps the younger children with thier homework and classwork. This is because students are getting bad grades in class. Also because they are failing the class and that will make them repete the grade or make them go to summer school. For example i went to summer school because i failed the 4th grade.

Next they can get thier grade up. so they dont fail the grade and go to summer school. Also because they can have an A or B for the rest of the year and they will past the grade and go to the next one. For example I did all my homework and class work and got an A and B for the whole year and I went to the next grade.

Lastly it helps the older children understant the younger kids. This is because they learn more about younger kids and what they like to do for fun when thier bored. Also because some older kids like younger kids some are funny and some aren't. For example i learned more about younger kids and that made me understant my little brother.

Think positive is good because when you can't get something good,you think positive a say a can due this again, and you try and you get correctly.

169528C31812,"According to the University of Washington, 89 out of 100 people who failure during the process for being successful think that failure is the worse thing they could find in the way for being successful. Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" People who failed feel that they will not have another opportunity to accomplish success, because they think that when failure comes they always are going to fail and their enthusiasm is not going to help them to be success. The best way to accomplish success is not going failure to failure because going failure to failure only cause more obstacles to overcome on people in order to be success, and being successful consist in working everyday with the same passion that we started the first day and making possible what others think it is impossible

One reason, why going from failure to failure is not helping people to be success is because going from failure to failure only causes more obstacles to overcome on people in order to be success. In fact, in 2017 a group of scientific found that when failure comes to people affect all their emotions and cause them more adversities to overcome, now they not only have to fight with the failure that they just passed they have to fight with their emotions. People not only want to be success in life, they also want to be success in all the problems they are expose to receive in the process for being successful in life. I once had a teacher named Generic_Name, she wanted to be the best teacher in her school, but some of my classmates did not pay attention her in classes. She was making all her efforts to make them focus in her class, but it did not work. She saw that all the efforts that she was making were not enought for making them better students, and her job was not being beneficial for us as she wanted. Months later, she gave up, she felt frustrated and she never could be the teacher that she was before. This can be one of the negative things that can happen to people if they fail during the process to achieve success.

Another reason, why success not consist going from failure to failure is because being successful consist in working everyday with the same passion that we started the first day and making possible what others think it is impossible. Success not only consist in accomplishing any goal, also consist in making every single moment something beneficial for us and even the world because success is not only going to make us to feel better, also is going to inspire others to make something good without confront any failure. I have a friend who wanted to be a soccer player, he started training everyday after school; everyone thought that he could not be a soccer player and he will fail in his first game, but he did not give up, at his first game he showed that he had the abilities to be one of the best soccer player in America. He continues working everyday as his first day. Years after, he received a call from Spain, it was a team who wants him to play for them. Now, he is in Spain playing in the best league of the world showing that all the work he made before was for a reason named success. Other people may think that failure is the best way for us for learning what we can improve during the process for being successful. However, failure is one of the most negative thing that we can find in order to learn to achieve success. It has been approved how failure had destroyed people in the way for achieving success.

In conclusion, success not consists in going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm, not everyone takes a failure as a positive thing. Most of the people think that failure only cause problems to resolve before they achieve success; those problems make the majority of the people to give up to the dream of being successful. Also, people felt defeated at their first failure causing them emotional problems. Being successful shows everyone how important its to go step for step and not failing in any of those negative problems that can happen during the process. In another words, success is the result of all the hard work and effort that we made before without failing; failure is only a destroyer of our dreams.

ED81EC443A69,"I remember one summer vacation, that my family and I took, where we went to another state to visit another relative that we haven't seen in awhile. Summer vacation had been the same for many years, summer vacation is when teenagers take a break from school to enjoy what they like to do during their free time. By having a long summer vacation, does not affect students to retain information from the past. teens should know that summer vacation is when they can enjoy their break to do what they want for fun.

First reason, why teens should know that summer vacation is for them to enjoy, is because they can spend time with their family. For example, the whole family can got to another state to visit another relatives that they have not seen in awhile. By spending more time with their family; consequently, teens can be more closer to their family. Teens can also, enjoy their summer vacation with their family by playing video games, watching movies, and go on a road trip.

another reason, why teens should know that summer vacation is for them to enjoy, is that they can hangout with friends. teenagers hangs out with friends to go to a party, or to watch a movie. by hanging out with friends teens can do what they think is fun for them and their friends.

that if you are aggressive with someone and you just met someone new, the person you just met will think your violent and will end up not wanting to be around you. But others that know the person can say that the person isnt aggressive nor violet and that they were just excited and it was just their form of reacting and that the person their calling aggressive is actually kind and lovely to be around.

I believe that first impressions are just first impressions, that they will just be what the person first thought of when they first met you, weather its bad or a good impression, i honestly believe that after the first impression you have to get the know and interact with the person first,

to be able to judge and decide if you want to be around the new person and keep having their presence in your life or decide to not get to know the person and part ways and have nothing to do with their presence in your life.

some say that first impressions are almost impossible to change because it just cant be done like for example if the person thinks poorly of you when they first meet you and will continue thinking poorly of you or if they think your a bad person they could take cousion to prevent something bad from happening to them and be abel to stay safe or when you meet someone new and the energy they give you is bad and you decide not to see the person again because the first impression they gave you was bad and later on you find out thrum others that the person is toxic and mean and your glade you went separate ways with that person before you got to close to them.

A5FAB4DB8F35,"According to New York Times students who take extracurricular activities have a better opportunity doing better in life. Students and their families should decide what extracurricular activities to be involved in. If students and their families were to choose what extracurricular to be involved in they would have more time to be out doors learning new things and also making new friends.

My first reason why students should decide what extracurricular activities to choose is having more time out doors learning new things. Students should be out doors instead of being inside all the time. The first time i decided to attend an extracurricular activity was when i was a freshman. I decided to go out and look for some activities i can be in because i would always be inside doing nothing. So i decided to be involved in a program where they can help me get into good colleges. I got a few good offers from different colleges by hard work. I was excited when i got these offers because I knew that I would have a bright future ahead of me. So i decided to take the UCLA college application and show it to my parents. My parents were so happy to see me as a first generation to go to college.

Generic_Name came up to me and asked if i wanted to play soccer with them because they needed an extra player, so i decided to join and play. when the match was over we hung out for a bit and went home. Ever since i meet Generic_Name and Generic_Name everything changed for me. Even though we might not get any school work done, extracurricular activities are important to have.

17F7A129F123,"Imagine A World Where Problems Never Existed

Time ago the Legendary American Jazz Musician Duke Ellington said,""A problem is a chance for you to do your best""

What does that phrase even means?, what he wanted to say? - That phrase has a lot of meanings for different people, on my case, I think it means that a problems is a way to be better, learn from them, think what would you do, think the best way to solve it. Thats what I think this phrase means.

For example, lets say that you had a problem with one of your parents about that didn't clean the dishes, your mom is really mad at you because she told to wash them before going to sleep. There are a lot of ways to solve this problem, but which one is the best? which one will help the most? what are you going to do?

Fist lets look at the problem, you didn't do the dishes in order of that your mom got mad at you, the best solution is talk to your mom about it, apologize to her, say sorry, and tell her that you will do it next time without excuses.

Do I agree or disagree with the phrase of Duke Ellington?

People will agree or people will disagree for me, I completely agree. Why? because you learn from problems, they teach to be a better person, they teach all of us what things you are not supposed to do. A problem can help you to keep moving on, trying your best at solving a problem because every problems has a solution.

Another example is big companies lets talk about Amazon, how many problems did Amazon had and how many problems they still having? they had a lot, but they find the way to solve those problems they took time but now they are on of the best companies in the entire world. They had their problems and they found the best way to get rid of them.

23DB1CEDA453,"In our life going to success it`s a goul for everyone who wants to bulid his or her skills. Although I agree with Churchill`s statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success.

There are many reasons that failure plays need to pursuit to success.

First some time when I play in video game with my friends on online we make squad first. Seconed we to discuss about plan to defeat against the player to win. Next we were playing as a team, but each round we are loseing in the game. Some of my friend get bored and they are not excited to continue in the game because of losing, but I said them that losing in the game make us to find the problem in squad. Later the problem was from the plan, one of my friend didn`t follow their plan and was playing alone so I told him that we can win in the game if you playing as a team. Later I saw that each round won in the game cause we were follow the plan and working as the team.

Seconed example that I learn in my life is in the school. Back home when I was taking a class in Math, my teacher was giving a lot of test, It was challange for me to study with her. When I take a test I fail in the test and Iam thinking that I can`t pass in Math. I always thinking that I said before this my challange and I should pass no matter I fail I believe in my self that can do.

51554EF59AC0,"Have you ever had a first impression on someone? It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. I agree with this statement because, everyone says something when they meet you. Impressions are a good way to look at character traits. Your Thoughts count when meeting someone.

Everyone will always say something when they meet you. For example, some say you can be nice or funny. Stating impressions are a good way to keep a conversation going. Some times impressions lead to a good relationship. Have you ever stated your impressions on someone? Has someone ever told you what they think of you?

When you look at someone and have your first impression. You are looking at their character traits. You determine if they match your traits. First impressions tell plenty about a person. First impressions is a prime example of character traits. This is how you make new friends. Have you ever made new friends just by saying your first impression on them?

Before you meet someone you always think to yourself. Have thoughts on someone. Some people can say stuff about you without you even knowing. This happens when they do not say it aloud. Those people say it in their mind. It is okay for people to do that. It is only a first impression. Sometimes people do this only because they know little of you but, assume things of you which they do not want to tell you.

I agree that first impressions are impossible to change. People will tell you what they think of you. What your character traits look like. Some will simply just not tell you but think it in their minds.

Now if you finish high school all four years, you could get a four scholarship to a college.

Hello I hope you doing well, my name is Generic_Name. The present letter is to let you now that I'm fascinating of your business management, and I'll be glad to visit it. As you probably know many students are compelling to participate, indagate, and discover about distintic occupations in the work place. I think that it will be the most exiting thing that I could do because probably I can find an appropiated place of my interest to work at.

In fact, I can learn about the resposability and most of the times the presure that some workers have. The importance of follow the rules, every little thing in the work place it could be important for me in the future.

To adapt in differents positions and the most imporatnt thing is to love what I would do, to be an applicated, and apassionated person in the place that I would like.

Nevertheless, many people hate their work because they never had the chance to visit many different places that they wanted, couldn't achive their goal or may be the postion that they wanted was alredy taken by someone else.

The resposability at work has to be the most important, if a worker doesn't have the resposability in their job it will be a big problem, they might not care about the job and the things that their boss asked for.

I would like to be the person who has the responsability and all the interest of my job, and be proud of myself by doing the right things.

Althought, I can learn day by day how to impprove without an advice of the manager and be the best worker in my area. Many people think that work is only to get money, and bored and they are there just because they need to pay their bills, the main reason of work is to love what you like and enjoy doing it.

FC5120C98AE7,"I think that all schools should offer video or online conferencing as well as online education form the school. Students should be able to be comfortable from where ever they are, and learn in a manner that they are comfortable with. There maybe different reasons where students may not come to school. However, if they do miss school students can have the abillity to turn in work and learn about what they missed. This would be good and better for teachers because students would have no excuse of them not turning in there work late or at all.

Students may miss school for all types of reasons, for exmple students can miss school for an urgent reason or a family situation. Some familys don't have enough resources to live off a good life, so, some students can't make it for school and have to work to support there families. In some cases familys have younger sibilings that they have to take care of, but the family can't afford to stay home and have to work. In that case families make students stay home to baby sit a little brother or sister. Students miss the education they need, and that's a good reason why they should have online based learning.

Having said that students may also be very sick and may not be able come to school. Students may also have variuse injuries that can be hard for them to move in certain areas, therefore they stay home and miss school. students could be in the hospital, and may not return to school for a long period of time, it could also be hard for them to transition back and catch up with his or her school work. Some students may be takeing care of a sick relative and my not be able to make it to school. online base learning would be very helpful to those students that are injured or sick.

Students also tend to leave the country, and go back to their countrys. Families make arrangements to visit their home countrys in the middle of the school year. in some cases families don't come back for long periods of time. Students tend to miss a lot of school work and education in the time they are gone. Online based learning would come in handy in this situation. Students could have fun where they are, and not miss a single assiegnment or a day they are learning something new.

Online based learning is the best solution to students missing school. It would be a great oppertunity for students to get back on track and finished what they started. I would recommend online based learning because I think of the families that are in deep need by the students that come to school in helping their families. I also think of the people that are sick, and that need rest at home. This program would help a lot of students get the education they need without worrying they won't get it.

Also your positive attitude you going to need everyday, because some people have a bad attitude so, they talks bad, they look bad, and they work bad. That type of people,who have bad attitude always have bad days, because they think that everything it's bad, they don't transmit a good energy, however the people who always have a positive attitude, they talks good, they respect each others so, that type of person who trasmit a good energy to their family, that's when they don't believe in something that, you are that peron who help that people to change their mind, but always with a positive attitude.

However, Self-reliance is part of the nature we can believe in ""God"" even if we don't go to the church people just do what is right and be a good person.

People who practice self-reliance might get an experience of what they be do right and what be wrong with them. Nature is a beautiful place where people can be happy all time and they don't worry about nothing because they think they been doing the right thing, self-reliance is practice just for people who wants to do everything in you own. Second,Self -reliance is fact that just people who wants to do things by themselves can practice they feel confidence about all they can do in you own and they do not trust in the others people because they think the others people can tell them to take a bad decisions for this reason this people believe in themselves so nobody can distract them.

Therefore, This people who values self-reliance think that you can believe in ""GOD"" even if you do not go to a church just be positive of all you do is the right and you no hurt others so they can't hurt you; it is a good way to put in practice the individuals that you have and what you believe too.

73E8763E5F73,"Dear Principal,

I think that you shouldn't make all students do community service. Because maybe some of us want to do other things. Or maybe some of us have to do other things like homework or baby sit. To me not all the time students are going to want to do community service. Because if it were me I wouldn't want to do community service myself either. I TRUELY know that helping the community is important. But don't you think that our own time is important too? I'm not trying to be selfish with my time. If you really do think about it then maybe you'll understand where I am coming from. I probably don't make any sense to you, but not all students might want to do it. From my opinion I do not think that you should make all students work on their community service. I agree with the students that help others, and tutor elementary students and also pick up litter. But I think I'm going to agree more with the other half of the students. Because to me it kind of does take a lot of time away from the things we do or the things we want to do. For one example: say like if you have a whole lot of homework to do and its due tomorrow. But you also have the community service. What are you going to do the community service that your principal requires for you to do or the homework that's mandatory? See not all the time were going to have our time to do the things we need to do. I say that what if you give us a vote in on it. And we'll give you (the principal) the results for what all of us students think is better for us. Because i know that even when we do the things we want to do or the things we need to do we can also help others at the same time like tutor the kids that need help in what were working on. Some students might want to agree with you and some might not want to. So yeah! That's my suggestion on what you should and shouldn't do. Please take the time to read over this letter and think about it. Thank you very much!

D129F19FF7F7,"People should make their own decisions to avoid bad guidance from other ""experts"".

Everyone should make their own decisions because they know themselves better, they know what they like and what they want, mentally and physically. For example if someone bought someone else something that they didn't like or didn't want and is the total opposite of what they needed, they wouldn't have sent the other person to go get it in the first place, now would they?

Also, people should make their own decisions so that they could learn from their own mistakes and their misjudgments. For example, people buy the wrong size of clothing online everyday without trying it on in stores first. People will now know to go in stores first or to get themselves measured first before ordering clothes online. Another example, is that people look at something they think is interesting and nice, but won't read the directions or the descriptions that come with it and once the package that they got or ordered it at their homes and in their possession is either not like the picture or is smaller then what they thought it would be or is just one piece of what you ordered. This is a great learning experience for them to not do it again and to always read the descriptions of what you're ordering comes with.

Lastly people should make their own decisions because not all ""experts"" can really help you with your situation or not even do so well on your case. For example, people can pay a lawyer a huge amount of money for them just to fail on your court case. Another example, people pay to see a doctor for something they think is wrong with them because they're hurting badly and doctors will say you're perfectly fine and prescribe you an expensive pain killer, which people can already have at their homes. Last example, a therapist can also prescribe you medication that you don't need but will still give it to you because they can. Some therapist don't believe in that but most do.

So therefore, these so called ""experts"" sometimes don't know what they're doing or sometimes they are trying to make money out of innocent people or even sometimes is it always okay to make some mistakes and learn from them and your misjudgments. So it is always better to make your own decisions to avoid bad guidance from others.",Female,11,Hispanic/Latino,347,418,407,15,5,81.4,53.96066253,40.19138756,168,418,Independent,Economically disadvantaged,Self-reliance,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,"people should make their own decisions to avoid bad guidance from other ""experts"". everyone should make their own decisions because they know themselves better, they know what they like and what they want, mentally and physically. for example if someone bought someone else something that they didn't like or didn't want and is the total opposite of what they needed, they wouldn't have sent the other person to go get it in the first place, now would they? also, people should make their own decisions so that they could learn from their own mistakes and their misjudgments. for example, people buy the wrong size of clothing online everyday without trying it on in stores first. people will now know to go in stores first or to get themselves measured first before ordering clothes online. another example, is that people look at something they think is interesting and nice, but won't read the directions or the descriptions that come with it and once the package that they got or ordered it at their homes and in their possession is either not like the picture or is smaller then what they thought it would be or is just one piece of what you ordered. this is a great learning experience for them to not do it again and to always read the descriptions of what you're ordering comes with. lastly people should make their own decisions because not all ""experts"" can really help you with your situation or not even do so well on your case. for example, people can pay a lawyer a huge amount of money for them just to fail on your court case. another example, people pay to see a doctor for something they think is wrong with them because they're hurting badly and doctors will say you're perfectly fine and prescribe you an expensive pain killer, which people can already have at their homes. last example, a therapist can also prescribe you medication that you don't need but will still give it to you because they can. some therapist don't believe in that but most do. so therefore, these so called ""experts"" sometimes don't know what they're doing or sometimes they are trying to make money out of innocent people or even sometimes is it always okay to make some mistakes and learn from them and your misjudgments. so it is always better to make your own decisions to avoid bad guidance from others.",5

Singing makes me happy because whenever I'm done singing a song it makes me smile. Once I'm done singing a song I'll have the urge to sing more because I love to sing. Ever since I was a little girl I would occasionally ask my dad to sing to me and ever since then I've always been passionate about singing. I sing whenever I'm sad and then I choose a song and I'll sing to the song I chose and it'll make me happy.

Me and my best friend play around a lot and when we do we'll start singing but in a fun way. We'll be so off key. And start goofing around. We'll do singing contests. This one time we did a singing contest that went on for hours and it turned out to be a tie. So we did a rematch and she won that rematch. So we had another one then I won.

Singing has been helping me relieve my stress a lot lately. Because since SOL's are like right around the corner I've been singing to just get my mind off everything that's stressful.

Students who have difficulty with subject will have better understanding of what they are learning. It would be pleasure of people who volunteer for during school homework club.

Although some students who have difficulty with specific subject homework would be great. There will be teacher and students around. Maybe its their same teacher who teaches the same class it will be great for students. Teachers will know the weakness of student of what they need help more with during class. This is why during school homework club would be great for teacher or students.

Some homework club cost money which might be hard to pay for some families. If my school would have homework club it should be free.

ACE3E472041C,"Does taking classes from home benefit students.

People might said that,taking classes from home is a bad idea, that is not useful that kids don't learn and they do nothing. In case other people will said that it benefit kids , that keep them safe and I will agree by saying that taking classes from home benefits kids.

Well I think that parents, who decided that their kids need to take classes online is for one of many reasons. for example , I will provided you three reasons why

I think kids do home classes and it does benefits them and yes they learn from it .

Parents are famous and they cant send their kids to a regular school,kids might be in danger and they can attend school because of that or it might be because they have any medical condition.

First reason why students take classes from home is probably because their parents are famous people and they know that, if they send their kid to any school, people will be chasing them,asking for pictures all the time or may be telling them bad stuff. Parents know that in that situation kids are going to be frustrated about it, sad, angry and defently they will not be able to concentrated at school. It will be hard for them to be free and enjoy school. For example on of my friends he is very famous in my country and also in here wherever he goes people is always chasing him, hi has a kid that is 6 .years old but he said that the hardest part is when the little boy goes out all of these people get to him and he gets scared. That's why he said that he decided to pay for home classes, and they prefer their kids to take classes at home. Kids will feel free and no body will be making them feel uncomfortable.

Second reason it could be because the life of any kid can be in danger and the parent of the kid and also any school will know it. They know that if any kid, that is been treated lets said by any organization, attends to school people will try to harm him or it can become a bigger problem. Because the school will defently knows that if they received that kid at school they will be putting the life of many other kids at school in risk and they will not take that change. Of course parents are not going to allow that their kids to be harm or kill. That's why the school or parents proffered to have their kid to take his/her classes from home he/she will be safe and other people too, the kid will get a really good benefit from it because he will learn and he will be safe and other people will be too.

Last reason why students get benefits from taking classes at home is probably because they have any medical condition and it's hard for them to attend any school. They will feel shame,afraid,scared and they will be thinking that everyone at school is going to make fun of He/She, that they will bully Him/Her and of course as I have said before parents will never for any reason are going to let their kids to be unhappy to feel bad to feel frustrated and feel that no body love them that's why they let their ids stay at home and take classes from it so that way they learn and no body will harm them make they feel worthless.

in conclusion,parents who made the decision to let their kids stay at home and take classes from home they make one of the biggest and hardest decisions in life. Because they know that kids will be safe nobody will hurt them, be hunting them , no body will hurt them, tell them mean stuff. They will not feel embarrassed to let people see them, Parents know that defently is not going to be the same that it will not be the same as if he was listening directly to his teacher and getting his note but they know that at least his kids are going to be safe and they will learn to they will still get benefits from it.

When you want the best for your kids and you love them more that life itself, you do what you got to do if that means to pay for his classes in other to keep them safe,and we all know that people might talk and told you that doing home classes isn't going to help you.

30DDC17D2986,"First impressions are very important but could they be changed?. Yes, yes they could be changed because first impressions don't justify who you are as a person and some people don't act the same when you first meet them. However some people are really judgmental about first impressions and could block off any type of relationship they had with you being job related, maybe girlfriend or boyfriend, and friends.

First impressions are serious which drives a lot of people insane. Because they don't know how the people are going to react to them but, its okay that doesn't define who you are as a person. A great tip of advice is being able to read a room that means how people are acting in certain time and place. Like whats the vibe and mood if you should be more relaxed, goofy,serious etc. If you can read a room first impressions will become a lot easier because you will know how to act.

But that's not the only way to have a good first impression most people dont act the same say on the first date,its probably going to be awkward and silent because you dont know how to act verses seeing someone for the 5th time. You know what to say, you know how to have an okay conversation. But dates arent the only situations that first impressions fall into. Jobs, jobs are the biggest make or break for first impressions from experience you can't be nervous and just be real you dont have to act differently. If your job takes you for what you have then its a great job.

However first impressions are very very judgmental. Some people take first impressions over anything because its the first glimpse they have of you and how you act as a person.

F1DF4F89F70D,"Do you think that too much oil in your food affect your health, or it improve the ability of how you work at school? I think food that contains too much oil makes you get sick and that's what we have right now, but others think different and they have their reasons too. Although some say that the school's cafeteria should not change their food because the food that they are offering right now is especially made to make students work better actually, the school's cafeteria should change their food because it gives students more variation to eat and by having a healthier food less students will get sick.

Those who think that the school's cafeteria should not change their food have their reasons. One reason is that the food that they are offering makes students work better; this is because it has a lot of oil. Scientific studies say that oil awake people, and make people do their usually activies better. Also, students who have their test after lunch, and they have eat something that contains a lot of oil; they tend to get better scores than those who didn't eat at lunch; this might be because some of them can't think with the stomach empty, or it can be because oil really helps them concentrate, who knows right. The oil food doesn't sound that bad, isn't? but I will tell you next what is what I think that is bad about it.

There are many people who think that the school's cafeteria should change their food. This is because they have their reasons, one reason is to make students eat healthier; this will help prevent students get sick. There are many sicknesses caused by oil, and one of them is cholesterol; cholesterol can kill people if you don't know how to take care of it. Also, by preventing students get sick they will not lose any day of school, and that will help them have good attendance and they will not get lost in their important classes. For example: Science, Math and History.

Another reason to change the cafeteria's food is that it will give more variation for students to eat. This might sound simple, but by giving them more variation to eat; students will feel more free to explore food that they don't know. Also, students will feel more comfortable as if they were at home because you know that when you are at home food variate and that makes it fun. moreover, Variation of food will attract those who are more likely to stay out of the cafeteria; maybe they don't like the food that we have right now, and they are hoping that the cafeteria change the food. I think that by changing the food in the cafeteria will make a good impact in the school.

In conclusion, I think that the principal of my school should change the cafeteria's food because the variation of food will make a good impact in students who don't like to eat at lucn right now, and it will also prevent the majority of students to get sick. Eventhough those who don't want to change the food had a good reasons; ""The food that we have right now is made to make students be more active"".

Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". The failure plays an important role in the pursuit of success. A successful dreamer's life always have a lot of failures, but without loss the enthusiasm. Be perseverance do not let a person loss the enthusiasm still having failures. To accomplish a goal a person will have failure to failure without loss the enthusiasm.

Firstly, failures have an important role in the pursuit of success. Is something impossible be successful without failures. Therefore, every single human have a dream and everybody want to accomplish their own dream, but it cannot be accomplish without mistakes as a failures. For example, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was an important leader from the movement of Civil Rights. He fail his own opinion and rights in from of people who were more powerful than Dr. Martin, but with those failures he was a successful leader of Civil Rights. In others words, in King's life failures played an important role in his pursuit of his own success.

Secondly, every successful life will have failures, but the point is do not loss the enthusiasm. Have the power to still having enthusiasm when everything is fail make a person pursuit of success. In others hands, a successful life is constructs by a lot of failures, but without loss the enthusiasm that let you still pursuing. For example, Gabriela Douglas was the first gymnast with a gold medal in the United States. In her professional life, she had a lot of failures. One time she broke her right leg when she had her first presentation in the best school of gymnasts in Japan with the best trainers, but Douglas was helping herself and she was taking therapy sections to be ready for the next presentation where she was accepted. In others words, the key to be successful with failures is do not loss the enthusiasm.

Thirdly, be perseverance do not let the people loss the enthusiasm with failures. Have a perseverance character make the the people strong in front of failures. Many people said that be success does not consists of going from failure to failures without loss of enthusiasm. In others words, when a person want to be success and in that road have a lot of failures it force this person to loss the enthusiasm as a result of those failures. However, a lot of people believe that is a kind of impossibility have enthusiasm when you have some failures. To retake Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success, success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.

In conclusion, Churchill's quote was humbling and impacting. The failure play an important role in the pursuit of success.

However, if you show them by how you act like for an example: you don't bother anyone, you show where a location is or try to, being polite, patience, showing manners, etc.

they will find you setting a good example or showing good behavior. Not only setting a good example can make people say you're a good person , it can also lead to ""good karma"".

Another thing is always set good example when you're out in public with a family member, because if you dont people will not like that and have your family at fault.

in this paragraph, i will say that I'm agree to have a positive attitude beacuse it's a good thing and important that people should have.

One reason why have a positive attitude, it's beacuse if you give a positive attitude to one person, that person will be nice to you, and you going to receive all the things that you want, and like you want to be, and that person going to give you back the same attitude to you, that means that if you give a positive attitude you goint to receive a positive attitude.

Another reason, is that people should always have a positive attutide to every single person, so the persons can be nice to you, and treat you like you want, and that can demostrate that you are a good person that have a possitive attitude.

Last reason, have a positive attitude always going to be a important and good thing, beacuse it's help you, that how can be nice to the people, and when you give a positive attitude to one person, and that person give back to you, it's feel good, beacuse they treat you very nice, they smile to you they ask how is going, that's the positive attitude.

My First reason is, students can have a future when they grow up. Also have time to think about their career and what they to want archive as an adult. Students need to think about their future career because, thats is what they gonna make for living, to take care of their self, and family. This is one reason why, I believe students should commit to a career at a young age.

My Second reason is that, students get prepared on the career the're choose; Students can learn more about the career. Also think about the things they have to have: a car, a collage degree, high school diploma. Some career's require certain requirements for the job. But at the early age, you can start to get parts of the requirements they ask for to apply.

My Third reason why, Student's should commit to a career at a young age, is for they can take advantage of the help they have at school. Some school's have academy at different schools for students. They can take free classes to help them and get experience of the career they have chosen. After completing the academy class, students will get a completion certificate, from the teacher. The certificate can help students, with applying to their future career by, showing the company that the student has some experience. Some jobs require certain requirements for the job like: having a collage degreee, a high school diploma, classes to take to get experance.

4256A9A1767F,"In my oppinion people should seek guidance from expercts and authorities about life's important matter instead of making thier own desisions. A few people may not agree, but I personally strongly agree with my oppinion is very important. I belive asking and sharing our ideas lead us to making better desisions. Here are three reasons why seeking guidence from expercts and authorities is better than making desitions on your own.

In addition, confusion is one of of the most common reasons why people end up making bad desistion. A lot of people might not know what it is going on or how to make a good desicion because it is probably their first time going through a situation they have never been in. I was not in a position to make my own desistions, because I was young and confused on what was going well untill I asked someone for help,but when I started making my own desitionsions

Also, it leads you to do better when you communticate with others and gives you a better understanding on why making your desision with others helps you out more. When I began to speak out about my desisions to my closest friends and they helped me make me feel that I was not going through it alone and they always made sure that the desision I understand the desision I was taking before even making my next move. It honestly helped me a lot.

Furthermore, it makes your life less stressful. You talked about what you were stressing about instead of bottling It all up. It is like some stress relive. For exapmple, you have a big heavey backpack full with books inside and when you get some out the way, you take some books out , and the backpack feels less heavy. I would feel relive on talking about what was stressing me out when I had to make a desision, because it is hard.

In conclusion, Not only do you make a desision but you uderstand, you communicate, and you feel relived about your desision.

37193A72B5D2,"Teachers and some adults think that some students are expected and have the capacity to identify a career by the time they enter high school. Student are the only ones who can decide If they are able to take care of that responsibility or not.

In my opinion I think different and I don't think that young students are able to carry out with a career and a will support my reasons. First of all I think about all of that students who are already independent by their self, they probably have a job and need to pay their own bills, the rent, their phone, and they maybe have no time to carry out with all of that responsibilities with their education and the career at the same time, they need to work hard study and that is not easy for them. As the same time they probably have a lot of homework to do and they need to be responsible at their job. Another good reason I have is that some students without time they have no help, and they have no support from other people to try and see if they are able or they are already capacity to care about the career in high school, many students are able to do it but some of them are not able to pay for the help or the stuff need for the classes, some students have the luck to find people who just want to help them, and give them the opportunities to go on and help them with the decision they take to carry out with the career in high school but teacher or other people just don't want to help them just because they think and the give their opinion that they are not ready to take that decision and they still learning and have not the capacity to work on it and they just leave them and the don't give the students the opportunity to explain or show them that they are able to do it. Also a lot of students are fighting and giving all of they can with their education and they are giving up, they get tired with all the classes they have with all the responsibilities they are carry on and that why is hard for them keep studding in high school but must of the student are strong and still working to getting prepare even if they are having problems at their house or problems with their family they just wanna move on. Even though that some of students are too young in high school and they are still learning about how life is, how hard is to take care about the responsibilities the adults are already taking on and they think how hard can be if they take the decision to identify a career by the time they enter in high school it can be difficult to them because with the rest of the courses the are taking they will take more then normal classes. For some reason the students are not even thinking about their career when they are just enter the high school they are probably focus in the responsibilities they are going to have or they are already have in high school with their education, they have to take care of them. A lot of student make a mistakes, for example when they doesn't care about their education and they focus on being the best in their personality how many friends can they have or how good can they look, they need to ripen on their attitude and star thinking about their education they need to think how good in their education can be better on or how good grades can they have to make their family proud or how far can they go if the keep working hard and make proud of their self.

People can think that it would be easy for them or some of they can think that it will not.

We have to be society to not procrastinate about daily tasks. If we are always participating and if we are always involving ourselves in an event or task that is beneficial to oneself or other. It helps build a sense of standards for society and also builds up a persons attitude

Accomplishing something does not always mean achieving a goal, it could also be perform regular tasks with the best benefits.

They have to fight for benefits what they want and no waist any opportunity. In my case i am always an inactive person and lose a lot of opportunity along the way. The opportunities I had and i lost because i am an inactive person and that's bad.

Lot of students can't stay without cellphones; however, they should know the without phones in classroom they will learn more.

First, Students will get distracted if they have their phones in classroom.

They will be texting in class, and they will be on social media while the teacher is explaining. Furthermore, some students spend their class time, playing video games, watching movies, or videos on YouTube. It also distract other students that really wants to learn. Sometimes, the teacher allows students to use their phones in classes for educational purpose; however, the students take advantage because they use that time for playing some music on YouTube or taking pictures around the class, so I would not recommend teachers to let them use their phones in classes. I remember the time when I was in 9 grade, I often used my phone in classroom. I thought it would not affect my grades; however, at the end of the semester I saw only D in all of my classes. I stopped using my phone in class, and my grades were getting better.

Second, students should keep away their phones in classes for safety. I believe that no one is perfect and there are some students who doesn't have a good behavior in school, so they use their phone for taking inappropriate pictures. In addition, we have seem some examples in other schools about terrorism, and we don't know what students do outside or what kind of friends they have out of school, so the student inside of school may be stay in contact with terrorist outside of the school in case of any terrorist attack. The teacher will be thinking that his or her students are reading about the topic in the class, but the true would be that students are using their phone in a different purpose.

The Department of Education should establish a law about not allow students to use their phones in classroom or not use it at all in schools because they won't be able to pay attention, and because is a good way to keep safety in the school. Some may say, students need their phones in class for search information or call for any emergency; however, students don't need their phone when the school provides computers for searching any information, and they don't need their phone for emergency because the school provides police officers and good strategies to protect them in case of any emergency.

In order for growth and improvement, one must be required to step out off their comfort zone. Because aiming high comes with better resluts, it can serve as motivation to completing a goal. Although one may fail while aiming high, you will gain experience and knowledge from the situation.

To begin with, growth comes with attempting to accomplish new things out of your comfort zone. While always staying in your comfort zone, aiming low, you will be confining yourself, which prevents you from improvement. When you set your aim high, it assists with finding out what you are truly capable of. For instance, when working towards a goal, it comes with finding your true self. You can learn about your interests and hobbies, or even new ideas and thoughts that come to mind. When setting you aim high, it improves you as a person and helps with your own growth.

Not to mention, aiming high for a goal is possible when you have the right mentality.

When you aim high, the results are more motivating than when going for a goal set low. For instance, when achieving to graduate high school, one may aim to graduate as valedictorian. Being the valedictorian comes with great results such as getting into a better college or even just feeling better about yourself. If you put your mind to it, belive in yourself, and work hard towards it you will be able to accomplish any goal.

Furthermore, failing at achieving a goal provides experience. When you fail, you can use that situation to understand where you went wrong. In order to succeed the next time you attempt again, you can improve your mistakes. Failing is essential to the learning process as it gives you a chance to better yourself to prevent future mistakes. This knowledge you have accumulated from this certain situation, will be useful if applied to other life problems. On the other hand, when you aim for a low mark, there is no learning lesson you may gain.

However, some people believe nothing is wrong with setting your aim low. Instead, they believe that going for a goal set too high is worse as it means it will come with failure. These people view failing as a discouragement as others may consider them as a weak.

However, aiming high and failing gives you a life-longing experience by having the chance to improve your mistakes. When attempting again, you will have gained the knowledge to do so.

In conclusion, I believe that setting our aim too low and achieving it is far worse than aiming high and failing. For the fact that we need to grow as a person, we can not always stay in our comfort zone. By setting goals too low, we are preventing ourselves to grow and improve. By setting goals to a higher level, we can gain experience and knowledge that comes with the path to achievement.

DC247D62DB3E,"Why do people need to follow their own instincts and ideas?

I think people should make their own decision because they have to follow their own instincts and their own ideas. They have to believe themselves because if you not believe on you ,so no one can believe on you too.

First of all,I think people should make their own decision because they have to believe on themselves. They don't have to think as much because the ideas come from their mine not from someone else. When they have to think of some ideas that mean their don't have to ask ideas from anyone. When they have to do some writing that mean they don't have to copy from someone or from internet.

Secondly,I think people have to follow their own instinct because when something happen to you that mean you don't have to wait for someone to help you solve a problem. They don't have to seek for guidance because you have confidence in yourselves already.

In addition,They have to believe on themselves because if you not believes on you by the way no one can't believes on you too. For example,like when you have to do a presentation in class and you have to present in front of teacher but you not believes that you can do it, so it mean the teacher might not believes on you too. After that is might effect to your grade because when you have to present you keep asking teacher that you say the right thing or wrong.

Conclusion,I believes that people should make their own decision because they have to believes on themselves first before they ask for some help. They have to believes on themselves because if you not believes on you by the way no one else can't believes on you too.

9685DD18847A,"Some students don't have an idea of what career they want to take when they enter high school. Family members and teachers expect students to know what career they want when they enter high school, so it can help them choose the classes they need. I think students should have time to choose what they want to major in.

One reason I think students should have time to think what they want to major in is; they can get tired of the career they chose or change their mind of what career to take. For example, my friend Generic_Name is in AFROTC, she has been in AFROTC for 3 years. In her Junior she decided she wanted to leave AFROTC to do something else, she wanted to do nails instead. If Generic_Name can leave AFROTC her scheduled for the next school year can change. She will have to learn how to do nails and learn the more, difficult, ways to do them as well. For this reason it will be good for students to take their time and find out what they really want to take. They have all of high school year to think about it before they entering college.

Another reason students should think about what they want to major in is, they don't know what career to take or they could have many options but can not chose one. One career could be too difficult or one could be fun but not earn has much. Students should look over the careers they want and see if it is right for them. For example, I have 3 careers I'm thinking about but can not choose one. I have 1 year to think about which one. For me photography would be the one for me as I like to take pictures of the most beautiful places in my home town. I would also like to see other parts of world, see beautiful people who live there, work with amazing people, and see what I can take a picture of. i also want to the world to know what is going on fromw the different parts of the world and not the news. i want people to see it not hear.

Some students already know what career they want to take. Most of the students are thinking which one will be good for them, and which suits them the best. It is good for students to know what career they want, but it is also good for them to think it over or think it through. As students already know what they want to do and go straight to college. Some students like to take a break and not go to college right after they leave high school. These students are taking a break to figure out what career to take, what college to go to, and save money to be able to go to college. This can help the students in many ways. In one way if the student does not like their major and think its too hard it will change major. The student will keep changing major until it finds the right for him/her. By taking a break the student can think if he/she really likes the career they have chosen.

For all of these reasons I do think it Will be good for the students to take their time on choosing a career. They don't have to have a hard time choosing one or changing the career for another one. If they don't have an idea of what career they have a lot of time. They can take a break and think very well about their options. It can help them from not changing majors when they are in college.

BFA85508393E,"The benefits of having a good attitude can get you alot of things. For example if your having a difficut time someone that can help you because since you have a good atitude and a postive relationship with him or her. You can also get a good job, good grades and getting into good collages. I have a good attitude and that helps me alot in school and outside of school too. I get rewards and my teachers can count on me. I have friends who also are having good attitude and they have been successful in their life even outside of school. I have friends who had difficult times but since they were nice to me I was helping them. Even though the difficult time they have they are still positive. People credit some of their successes to their good attitude and they thank of having really good attitude because some of them say ""without it I don't know where I would be today.""

It is true because there are some people with bad attitude do not have a good success in their life later on. Some don't get jobs because of their attitudes or sometimes they do get good jobs but they do not get paid as well as others. Sometimes some people can get fired and can not get a job. Maybe some of times they get jobs but not as good as their last one was. People suffer sometimes with bad attitude because they become homeless or really do not have enough to pay thieir bills and that can effect them pretty bad because if you pay your bills you might not have money for your food and water.

With bad attitude can also lead you into bad thing such as joining a gang, doing drugs and/or vaping. If you have a good attitude you would be most of the time healthy and doing good things. Sometimes people get their attitude from others. For example they can get it from adults, family or some of the tmes their friends and then most of the time they copy how thier adttitude good or bad they try to copy them and most of ther time people try to copy celeberites. I have witnessed people trying to have the same attitude as other person, From my own experience people have changed their attitudes good and bad but most of the time good.

When people change their attitude to good it is because someone influence them to change how they are acting and so most of the time their acted gets changed. When it comes to a bad attitude people most of the time people are making them do bad desisions and so that effects how they think, act and decide what are they going to do so mostly people make the bad desisions and so that is how their attitude changes from good to bad. Sometimes people have a attitude change because is something is happening in their life that is ouside of school and so their attitude changes. Another benefit of having good attitude is that you can help out others inneed and get them the items they need or you can a life by making good desisions. Another way that people's attitude changes is that when a person gets bullied and that effects how they are and how their attitude changes because the bully can be saying lots and lots of means things and mean words to the person and they have a adtitude change that changes how they are and what they do and sometimes dressed up like.

Sometimes your attitude can be change when are in a fight or arugument with someone and that attitude can be changed from good to bad. People can changed other people's attitude and sometimes it can be good or bad but it stills changes a person's attitude no matter what is it they can be changed. people's attitudes can be easily changed because if you convince someone to do these small things they are going keep doing the small things and they will keep doing it and thier attitudes start to change slowly and slowly untill their attitude completely changes. sometimes you do not even notice that your attitudes changes sometimes you just think that you are just acting the same as usually but at some point they would notice. When they notice they want to to better if they are being bad and they would want to be a better person and would try thier very person at it.

Sometimes people go to see someone and talk to them and that helps them more because they are talking to someone they can trust and can keep their secrets and so that helps them even if they do not it every day it still helps them slowly but it is still changing them. Sometime they want to fix their life up because they are trying to get back on their feet and start doing something different for once and they can help out others that really really need the help they can get. I know people who have changed from have a bad attitude to a good one because they are talking to someone and they also talk to me too. There is lots and lots of many ways people can change by having a pet. Another is to do something relaxing and not bring stressed.

Stress can be bad because it can change your attitude to a bad attitude and that is not good cause it can lead up to be things. Another theng being stress is being relaxed and not thinking about anything that can make you stressed or make you have anger because that can change your mood, actions and can get how your attitude is. Another way to not have a bad attitude is joing a sport because you can have fun in sports. For example you can play soccer with friends and have the best time ever and not be stressed. Or sometimes when you lose you get angry and mad so you be stressed out and that makes have a bad attitude because sometimes when you lose you get mad and start a fight with someone and is really really bad because that makes you out of control, makes you stressed out even more, makes you do desisions and that makes you have a bad attitude.

That can also make it so the other person your fighting with mad and stressed out too and makes both of you have a bad attitude and you will be even more stressed if both of you be stressed out at the same time. Another way is have a good attitude is to play games and to fun have fun and not be stressed out so you can have fun.

because if you pay your bills you might not have money for your food and water. with bad attitude can also lead you into bad thing such as joining a gang, doing drugs andor vaping. if you have a good attitude you would be most of the time healthy and doing good things. sometimes people get their attitude from others. for example they can get it from adults, family or some of the tmes their friends and then most of the time they copy how thier adttitude good or bad they try to copy them and most of ther time people try to copy celeberites. i have witnessed people trying to have the same attitude as other person, from my own experience people have changed their attitudes good and bad but most of the time good. when people change their attitude to good it is because someone influence them to change how they are acting and so most of the time their acted gets changed. when it comes to a bad attitude people most of the time people are making them do bad desisions and so that effects how they think, act and decide what are they going to do so mostly people make the bad desisions and so that is how their attitude changes from good to bad. sometimes people have a attitude change because is something is happening in their life that is ouside of school and so their attitude changes. another benefit of having good attitude is that you can help out others inneed and get them the items they need or you can a life by making good desisions. another way that people's attitude changes is that when a person gets bullied and that effects how they are and how their attitude changes because the bully can be saying lots and lots of means things and mean words to the person and they have a adtitude change that changes how they are and what they do and sometimes dressed up like. sometimes your attitude can be change when are in a fight or arugument with someone and that attitude can be changed from good to bad. people can changed other people's attitude and sometimes it can be good or bad but it stills changes a person's attitude no matter what is it they can be changed. people's attitudes can be easily changed because if you convince someone to do these small things they are going keep doing the small things and they will keep doing it and thier attitudes start to change slowly and slowly untill their attitude completely changes. sometimes you do not even notice that your attitudes changes sometimes you just think that you are just acting the same as usually but at some point they would notice. when they notice they want to to better if they are being bad and they would want to be a better person and would try thier very person at it. sometimes people go to see someone and talk to them and that helps them more because they are talking to someone they can trust and can keep their secrets and so that helps them even if they do not it every day it still helps them slowly but it is still changing them. sometime they want to fix their life up because they are trying to get back on their feet and start doing something different for once and they can help out others that really really need the help they can get. i know people who have changed from have a bad attitude to a good one because they are talking to someone and they also talk to me too. there is lots and lots of many ways people can change by having a pet. another is to do something relaxing and not bring stressed. stress can be bad because it can change your attitude to a bad attitude and that is not good cause it can lead up to be things. another theng being stress is being relaxed and not thinking about anything that can make you stressed or make you have anger because that can change your mood, actions and can get how your attitude is. another way to not have a bad attitude is joing a sport because you can have fun in sports. for example you can play soccer with friends and have the best time ever and not be stressed. or sometimes when you lose you get angry and mad so you be stressed out and that makes have a bad attitude because sometimes when you lose you get mad and start a fight with someone and is really really bad because that makes you out of control, makes you stressed out even more, makes you do desisions and that makes you have a bad attitude. that can also make it so the other person your fighting with mad and stressed out too and makes both of you have a bad attitude and you will be even more stressed if both of you be stressed out at the same time. another way is have a good attitude is to play games and to fun have fun and not be stressed out so you can have fun.",5

4ABC0ED00F91,"Do you believe that in order to success is going though failure contently? People think that going though failure can help you be successful though out time. Some example could be emotions, not giving up, and a quote ""Third time is the charm."" These are some of the things that people do in order to succeed though failure.

First, when people can not got something right the first time they can get emotional such as upset, mad, and frustrated and many more. An example of this could be when you are working on a math problem and you did not get the right answer the first time people can get upset. That is why emotions can be a part of failing to get successful.

Moreover, when people can not get something done they tend to just give up and do nothing. People should never give up because not everyone gets it the fist time. One example can be when you are trying to find information about an animal and you can not find anything on it so you just give up and not do the research information and now you are going to get a zero for it which is not good. This is why you should never give up even if it is hard for you

Although, most people have heard this saying ""third times the charm."" This saying has a meaning to it because it is telling you that you have to keep on trying in order to get it right. Sometimes when you keep on trying it can turn out better then the other times that you tried. One example can be when are drawing something and you do not like it you can try again and do it better then the first time. Keep on trying in till you like it or in till you get it right. This is why this saying is very important to understand.

2D63639F997F,"Is it having a possitive attitude the key to succes in life?

If someone would ask me if a possitive attitude is the key to be succesful in life. I honesty would agree with them. Because in a big part of life everyone is going to have to deal with ups and downs, Some more than others but everyone have to go through something bad for something good to happend. everyone have to fight for what they want, and on that fight is going to be bad parts and good parts but if you stay possitive most of the time you are going to win the fight , accomplish what you were loooking for and be succesful, But if you aren't just keep trying and be possitive everytime.

Always have possitive thoughts a possitive attitude and keep trying, Get up over and over intuil you accomplish your dreams, Do not give up because if something i have learn is that if you give up and think negative, you would never be succesful and know what you are actually capleble of, Thats why a lot of people is just stock in the same place because they are scare for what is going to happen, Because they have more negative thoughts then positive ones, That's making them not be succesful in life, thinking that they are better where they are and not where they can be.

A example from my life is when life just decided to punch me in the face, just change my life. About two years ago when i was in freshmen year of high school, my doctor told me that i have a bad arteria is the vein that gives oxygen to the heart, So i had to have a heart surgery.

This is how everything started, One day I woke up got ready to go to school, went to school like usual. at the time I was in middle school, Generic_School, I was playng soccer and i have got to tired went to the bathroom I felt like something wasnt right, I drop to the ground and felt nausia, I didnt give it any atention and just kept going with my day like normal. Almost around six months later i had another mini heart attack, But at the time i didnt know what it was. I was just laying on my bed and i just started feeling a sharp pain in the chest, But it went away in about 30 minutes. when everything got serious was later on about another six months later when I was at school at the time i was almost finishing freshmen year at Generic_School, my chest started to hurt badin class, So what i did was go to sleep in class and see if it would go away, Then when i woke up the pian wasn't there anymore. I wen to my house and about 4 hours later the pain started again and it was bad so I told my mom and we went to the emergency room in the hospital. At the time i had a infection in my trought so the doctor said that it was doe to the infection, then they told me to go to a heart specialist. The apointment was on a monday my mom had decided that we wern't going to go so she call the place to cancel the appointment and they told her that it was important for me to go because it was something serious. They told us that what i had was mini heart attacks, he told us that i was going to have to get a heart surgery because there was more posibilities for me to die of a heart attck then to die during the surgery, so i didnt have any other choise more then take the chance and have the surgery done.

The whole time i was pissitive, I wasn't scare at all i didn't have bad thoughts. So the day that i was going to have my surgery finally came. The doctors read to me all the chances that i had to die if something went wrong bacuse they had to stop my heart and conect the veins t a machine so they could work on my heart, i was just calm and thinking possitive all the time with a smile on my face and having a possitive attitude. I had my surgery and everything went perfect in a week i was out of the hospital, In about three months i couln't wait any longer so i got a job start working making moneyand going to school, always possitive. And now i am makin almost

$1,100 per week and i'm just 18 years old still bought my second car crash it fix it and sold it then I bought me a 2017 Subaru WRX STI and my life is just going better and better some down and ups but getting up no matter wha, always trying and giving bad moments a smile and always possitive because things always are going to hapend but that's how life is. I dont know where i would be right now if i had a bad attitude all the time, and negative thoughts, thanks god i'm still here alive.

F2CB99D1FE9F,"Dear Generic_Name, in our school is common to see many students working in groups. I would like to tell you that by working in group I can get a lot of benefits. For example, getting a good grade,

having a chance to meet new people, to know more about my classmates and even make new friends. I believe that working in group is more beneficial than working alone.

I think that having the opportunity to meet new people is really important. When I meet new people; I feel inspired, confident and happy. Because most of the time I like to share my ideas with other people. Although, not all time they will feel related to my ideas, but that's one way I make new friends by demonstrating my interest. I also like to hear peoples' ideas and stories. For example, I like to hear peoples' stories about their life and childhood.

I personally like to get good grades on school projects. I think that when I work in groups I feel more confident of what I am doing. I also do my work on time, and I even put an extra effort on my task to get a decent grade. For example, If I make a mistake my teammates will let me know. I will learn from my mistakes. If I make a mistake does not mean that I didn't try, I always try my best every day, to be a better person. So I can not complain that I do not have support because I do have it.

Some people say, that working in groups is not beneficial as working alone, people usually complain that they easily get distracted. But I think they are wrong. Because working in groups is more beneficial than working alone. When I work in groups I receive the support from my teammates. But when somebody is working alone they do not receive any support. So I think that working in groups is an easy and beneficial way to do my job and get a good grade.

When I work in group there's a lot a benefits I can get: I can meet new people, hear new stories from new people etc. If I get a school project and I have to choose whether to work alone or work in group, I will choose to work in a group without thinking twice. Because I have experience how good it feels to work in groups.

Schools make more accessible to access a school for the student can no attend to schools can be attend online from home and easy to access today technology, Help all the people to access to the internet and access to you works, Homework,

schools and other access have the internet the is make your works easy to do it, Today can speaking with your teacher for your homework and your teacher can helping from your home, The internet help if you use correctly.

some student use the internet wrong use for play game and other thing end this make the student no make the works in home,However some student no have access to internet and no have access the schools and any transportation and is so far to go schools no have any access to learning, In this place have to works to help all the people want to learning and can no learning because no have any access to the internet, Or no have the money to buy devices to have access to internet how can learning I think have to works in that.

Learning is no hard if you want to learn you have to effort to do it, You have to propose with you because you no want learning you never learn because you no want always in the lief have problem in something, sometime you believe I can no do it because you no propose always have option, For example the student can learning reading book for math, science,language have many option to help the people can no have the option to learning and home in you school and internet, book, have many option.

049B81A96C80,"Albert Einstein once said, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge."" In my opinion, I would have to agree to this statement. I believe that if you have a great imagination, it's better than just knowing a lot of information. The reasons why I think that imagination is more important is because imagination helps the mind grow and expand, it gives you more personality, and it can help you be more creative in life.

The first reason why I think that imagination is more important is because it helps the mind grow. Knowledge can help the mind grow as well, but imagination is overall more effective. Without it, your brain would be filled to the brim with words and numbers. You would only think about info and graphs; your mind would constantly be fixated on it. With imagination, your mind can be allowed to wander and explore new things, things that you might not have thought about before.

The second reason why it is more important is because it gives you more personality. If you didn't have any imagination in your brain, your personality would be bland. You would be practically hollow in terms of feelings; sometimes completely devoid of some emotions. With imagination however, you can express yourself more. You aren't bound to a certain feeling or emotion; you can be free to feel however you like.

The third and final reason why it is more important is because it can help you to be more creative. Creativity is a big part in growing your mind. Imagination can help strengthen your creativity, and make you feel creative in general. If there was no creativity in the world, a lot of ideas and products could have never come into fruition.

Most of the everyday things that we use, like phones or the world wide web, could have never existed had it not been for creativity. And of course, in order to have creativity, you need to have an imagination.

In conclusion, the reasons why imagination is more important is because it helps the mind grow, it gives you more personality, and it can help you to be more creative. Of course, this is only my opinion, so it's okay if you think that knowledge is more important. I can see how knowledge could be more important, and I can respect that choice. However, if someone asked me on what I think is more important to have, I would respond with imagination.",Male,8,Asian/Pacific Islander,386,414,410,24,6,68.33333333,47.96161693,37.43961353,155,414,Independent,Not economically disadvantaged,Imagination,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5.0,5.0,4.5,"albert einstein once said, ""imagination is more important than knowledge."" in my opinion, i would have to agree to this statement. i believe that if you have a great imagination, it's better than just knowing a lot of information. the reasons why i think that imagination is more important is because imagination helps the mind grow and expand, it gives you more personality, and it can help you be more creative in life. the first reason why i think that imagination is more important is because it helps the mind grow. knowledge can help the mind grow as well, but imagination is overall more effective. without it, your brain would be filled to the brim with words and numbers. you would only think about info and graphs your mind would constantly be fixated on it. with imagination, your mind can be allowed to wander and explore new things, things that you might not have thought about before. the second reason why it is more important is because it gives you more personality. if you didn't have any imagination in your brain, your personality would be bland. you would be practically hollow in terms of feelings sometimes completely devoid of some emotions. with imagination however, you can express yourself more. you aren't bound to a certain feeling or emotion you can be free to feel however you like. the third and final reason why it is more important is because it can help you to be more creative. creativity is a big part in growing your mind. imagination can help strengthen your creativity, and make you feel creative in general. if there was no creativity in the world, a lot of ideas and products could have never come into fruition. most of the everyday things that we use, like phones or the world wide web, could have never existed had it not been for creativity. and of course, in order to have creativity, you need to have an imagination. in conclusion, the reasons why imagination is more important is because it helps the mind grow, it gives you more personality, and it can help you to be more creative. of course, this is only my opinion, so it's okay if you think that knowledge is more important. i can see how knowledge could be more important, and i can respect that choice. however, if someone asked me on what i think is more important to have, i would respond with imagination.",7

They feel that because if the school extending two hours more, we can have more time with our friends. I believe that because you can do homework,expending time with your friends, and learn more.

One reason why the school days can extending two hours is because alot of students need help with their clases,teachers can help us to pass the clases and that it is good time the students think about, if they want to graduated they can make an effort to pass the clases and don't distracted other people in the classroom. Students have bad grades because they don't listening to the teacher while she's explain. We have bad grades because the class is boring or the teacher is great with the students and she don't say anything when we are using our phones.

Second reason why the school days can extending two hours is because you can participated in school activities or, you can play in some games like Soccer, American football, basketball, and you can have more time with your friends and helping the soccer team. you can help to clean the school and decoring some of the classroom, or you can stay in the library and help to organized the books or doing homework, and we can use the computers to search and find what book we want read.

Third reason why the school days can extending two hours is because some students want to stay in the school doing projects or homework because they don't have time to do in their home some of they go to work, and others students have alot of homework from the others clases, and that's one reason why the teachers be mad with the student because they did not do his homework, and the students explain why he not did that homework we have alot of homework from the others clases and i don't have to much time to do all the homework i have because at night i got to the bed early and the next day some teachers give me more homework and that's why i don't do your homework.

The last reason why the school days can extending two hours is because some students need help with their homework, they need to practice more to understand the class but the most important thinks that students need to have are good grades and pass all the test to graduated, if they have very good grades the school will give a certificated to saying we are proud of you, and your family will give to you some gifts because they are proud of you ,and you will graduated without trouble and then any university will accept to you because they will see your grades of your colleges and see how good you was in your clases.

8AB06719AED1,"Having a long vacation break for students is really need it, matter fact from my own opinion our break should be 4 months!, because we work hard to pass our classes. reason why this long vacation thing can help us in different ways most students would be ready for school after a long break, others would feel suprise, and some of us would care so much about school that they wish they was back!. after a long break students would be ready for school and very energized for their new classes, also their favorite teachers!. other students would feel suprise because of their new classmates or old classmates they seen in the pass, they would be fill with joy by seen their old classmates ,and their old teachers. Some students would even have dreams in their sleep wishing they're were back in school already to see their fellow friends and study their favorite classes!.

i disagreed with educators opinion on having 3-4 week of summer vacation this would make the students feel less active in school because they gonna look at it like it isnt fair, most of them gonna be absent most of the main days, and some of them would just skip classes.

by the cause of having only 3-4 weeks of school the education department is going to have many issues on students coming to school. but it isn't a bad idea on adding more breaks during the school year, but others like their school days to be a long streak some students have plans on traveling with their parents to a foreign country, others in jobs that are trying to get paid full hours, and some students feel like staying at home and relaxing from that long school year. but if the educators want to withdraw some months from the summer vacation they going have to make school hours shorter!. this could become to great agreement by shorting the hours in school more students would find positive activities after school! and spent time with their families and also have more hours in their jobs.

I'f educators wanna come to an agreement on shorting the summer vacation, they should appeal a deal with us and we can say to withdraw hours from school days, like make us come around 7:30 and, end school school around 2:15.

FAC0A72D62EE,"Churchill's statement is important to American lives. Currently, people who fail always gets back up to keep on reaching for the goal they want to achieve. However, when people fail, they think they should give up and stop trying. It's important to discuss about these different sides. Churchill's statement is important for not giving up or quitting.

The first reason why we should never give up is that we learn from our mistakes. when you fail at something you have to understand that it's not the end of the world. If you don't get something right or you mess up on it, you'll know to get it right next time. It's always important to recognize that you can reach for you're goals to be successful. when you fight for what you believe in, you'll never go wrong.

The second reason why you should never give up is because you want to reach you're top goals. When you want something, you have to fight for it. People who fail or didn't do something right, they give up and say that they have wasted their time, But in life, we can't always win or do something right. we are bound to fail at some point in our lives and it doesn't feel good. However, we keep on pushing for it because we want to be successful and feel great about ourselves to know that we didn't give up.

On the other side, when people give up, they have fail. People who think they have what it takes to be able to get a job, being able to go to a good school, or pursuit their dreams without mistakes, is someone who's going to give up the moment they've fail. The people who got great jobs or got into a good school, worked hard for it. Even when things went bad, they didn't give up because they work hard for that purpose. Some people who fail, often say that they're not smart or not that good. If your not that smart, how are you here today? When you struggle on something, you have to understand that the people around you are the people that can help you with deal with you're problems. Friends and families are the people who can help you in your time of need.

Finally, whenever you have a goal or something you want to have, it's important to never give up or quit halfway through. A goal is something you want to have and by working hard, you know you'll able to reach it in no time. Whenever you get stuck or something goes wrong, you always have support from the people you know very well to help you.

Usually a lot of people are not in agreement with what they have. They want more and more they just wanna grow. However, this can convert like an addition this is where you doesnt care about your friends they just act like what they friends have they would take.

5E26C9276FE3,"If doing online courses or classes at home help students a lot more with their everyday life, is it really helpful to attend those things? Today I will discuss my argument on why online courses would definitely benefit students in their lives.

Waking up every weekday morning to go to class can be a hassle for some or even most students, but having to do online courses can stop you from waking up every morning to get to class before 7:20 am. The reason why I agree with this idea is that it benefits students who have to work at home or do other things in their life that can help them prepare for college courses or even multitasking alone. If you have to go to work at the morning while having a paper or even a project due the same way, you don't have to go to class in the morning. You'll miss your work and have to schedule for another time to clock in and it will be a whole mess for you if you don't have a online course. If you're a high school student and you don't have a job or anything else important for you to do all the time, you'll still benefit from having 8 hour classes then online courses.

Now, safety is the most important thing when it comes to your everyday life as an individual, so students going to school every morning, on a weekday, going from class to class until their 8 hours are up can very much raise their concerns about their safety and how they can prevent themselves from getting hurt. Students come to school making sure the school protects them while they are in their classes building up and getting their careers ready when they step foot out the school. If their can be one way to prevent those concerns, it has to be online courses. You don't want to have a call one day talking about your child being hurt while you're away at work, you wouldn't want to take your child back to school after what happened cause the school didn't do their job of protecting your kid while you were away. Thats why doing online courses will be a lot more safer and helpful for you as a parent. Doing an online course can reduce how much you have to pay when it comes to going to school.

The most important to me when it comes to an online course is that it can help me or even other students to be on their own and have more of a responsibility at home or wherever we are. Now I understand that you don't have to do online courses cause it doesn't help you focus or even give you as much of a responsibility when it comes to school things, but even some of the things we do in school can be really dumb and not give us as much of a purpose as to why we are doing what were are doing. If I was to get into a fight with someone, I would have to get detention or ISS or even be suspended or expelled, as to online, that won't be a problem cause i'm not going to be around no one or even be mad at someone because of something so dumb that shouldn't be the reason to why I came to school or even force myself into having a career or even an education. School is a way to understanding in the real world, as much as math or other things won't benefit me as much when I go out there and do what i've always wanted to do, it will still be important to me in my life.

Attending classes from home can benefit me and others in many different ways, but having to do so, there should be a responsibility to take while having to do online courses. Now, in the future, there should be a online course for all schools so there can be less of a safety hazard to students and less of a hassle when attending a public or private school.",Male,11,Black/African American,674,712,694,19,5,138.8,53.19537582,31.74157303,226,712,Independent,Not economically disadvantaged,Distance learning,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,"if doing online courses or classes at home help students a lot more with their everyday life, is it really helpful to attend those things? today i will discuss my argument on why online courses would definitely benefit students in their lives. waking up every weekday morning to go to class can be a hassle for some or even most students, but having to do online courses can stop you from waking up every morning to get to class before 720 am. the reason why i agree with this idea is that it benefits students who have to work at home or do other things in their life that can help them prepare for college courses or even multitasking alone. if you have to go to work at the morning while having a paper or even a project due the same way, you don't have to go to class in the morning. you'll miss your work and have to schedule for another time to clock in and it will be a whole mess for you if you don't have a online course. if you're a high school student and you don't have a job or anything else important for you to do all the time, you'll still benefit from having 8 hour classes then online courses. now, safety is the most important thing when it comes to your everyday life as an individual, so students going to school every morning, on a weekday, going from class to class until their 8 hours are up can very much raise their concerns about their safety and how they can prevent themselves from getting hurt. students come to school making sure the school protects them while they are in their classes building up and getting their careers ready when they step foot out the school. if their can be one way to prevent those concerns, it has to be online courses. you don't want to have a call one day talking about your child being hurt while you're away at work, you wouldn't want to take your child back to school after what happened cause the school didn't do their job of protecting your kid while you were away. thats why doing online courses will be a lot more safer and helpful for you as a parent. doing an online course can reduce how much you have to pay when it comes to going to school. the most important to me when it comes to an online course is that it can help me or even other students to be on their own and have more of a responsibility at home or wherever we are. now i understand that you don't have to do online courses cause it doesn't help you focus or even give you as much of a responsibility when it comes to school things, but even some of the things we do in school can be really dumb and not give us as much of a purpose as to why we are doing what were are doing. if i was to get into a fight with someone, i would have to get detention or iss or even be suspended or expelled, as to online, that won't be a problem cause i'm not going to be around no one or even be mad at someone because of something so dumb that shouldn't be the reason to why i came to school or even force myself into having a career or even an education. school is a way to understanding in the real world, as much as math or other things won't benefit me as much when i go out there and do what i've always wanted to do, it will still be important to me in my life. attending classes from home can benefit me and others in many different ways, but having to do so, there should be a responsibility to take while having to do online courses. now, in the future, there should be a online course for all schools so there can be less of a safety hazard to students and less of a hassle when attending a public or private school.",6

E8C554B25F19,"Do our character have to be formed by that way the we performed or by influences. Your character will be what yourself choose to make it. We should formed our character by influences beyond our control.

In addition, by the influences that we receive day by day we chooses how to be creating our character. For example, I introduced my character in the situations the I pass, that help me how to be a better person. Also, sometimes we take our family advice, they tried to persuade our character by doing incorrect things. In others words we can said that they just want to influences our self because they ready pass for al this things that is good because we can see how much love they have to us. Is wonderful when your mom tell you the she can't believe that way the you get influences because sometimes we don't want to get they advice but all that they said is correct event if we don't want to believe then. For example my parent always want the betters things to me but i know if i don't try to fix my character I going to have less opportunities to have a better job or a better future. Also, Things are necessary somethings is hart to change our character because we think the we are okay but other think all the appositive, so we never have to think the we are fine because the never is going to happened always we have to be better in some thing we need to be honest with our lives and accept what we are doing wrong is more better to accept our errors and there is went we are going to see how our character change in a better way and then we are going to feel happy about our character and our lives.

Moreover, The influences control our character by the way the we act and think. For example, I was a person the if something I don't like I really have to talk to you the was horrible. Also my mom help me to change my character in my way to act because went sometimes people tell me things the I really don't like I do bad faces to then, I was doing bad with that. In other way, we don't think in the consequences of having a bad character, sometimes we don't think if others are going to see the actions in our lives and they maybe are going to influences you but no we the same attitude, because some people have bad attitude to but all the influences help you in life because if you don't like the people act with a bad attitude you don't have to be like that to. Also, you have to be prepared to make the decisions of what changes you are going to make. Having a good character gives you large of opportunities people always is looking for person with a good character,because costumer look the. In addition, all thinks the people said about you help you with your character, don't feel sad because you change your way to think. Obviously the take your time because you are not going to change in one morning but with a professional character more doors are going to open and more opportunities came so take other people influences.

Some people argument the we should choose our own character traits, because some people just are going to tell you bad opinions in the way the you have to act. Moreover, some people believe the is no necessary to get a great character. In other hand we have to feel free in what we want to do we know what we need to change we don't have to do what others want because sometimes they just look for they benefits what is better for then and that dont have to be like that. In addition, some people don't care if you are okay, or how you feel. In addition others argument the is necessary listen to others influences because sometimes we don't find a way to resolve our character problems bur other know what to do and they try to find a way to make you live easy. For example, I know some people the dont know how to control they character when they are mad soy they contact person the know how to act in the situations. Also, some people take careers for find solution to person the have serious problems with they character I really dont know if is normal the people get mad went they want to eat, I have a friend with the problem in my point of view the is not normal because i never pass from the situation so I can't help her but people the have long time studying on the yes they can tell her what way to eat or i don't know but they have a solution for the problem in her character.

So always remember the a good attitude change to many things.

In addition they received influences by other help you with the control in your character by changing a your way to act and covert you in a better person. Also help your character in a better way to think, in be focus on your ideas.

3D4475C949C2,"The idea of schools allowing their students to take classes from home is is an excellent idea. Not all students learn the same way,or at the same pace as everyone else. Having the opportunity to learn in a way that is most comfortable for you, can really show improvements in grades. Students who are sick and are not able to attend school also have an advantage of doing missing work from home. This will give students no excuse for being behind with school work if their able to do classes from home.

Students that are often sick, or miss a lot of school because of personal reasons would have an advantage with doing their classes from home. If students have the opportunity to do classes from home they dont have to stress about returning to school, and having a lot of class work to make up. Therefore, students will no longer have an excuse for failing classes because of absences if they have the option to do it from home. When i had my surgery last school year it was nearly impossible for me to catch up on all my missing work, the only way i could do my class work was if someone picked it up from school. Unfortunately my parents both work so while i was out of school i had no way to do it from home. It was very difficult to finish all that work after getting back, because i was not given many options of getting the work done. If i was given the option to complete my class work from online this would have really helped me maintain my grades up.

Seniors might be in the position where they need more than the usual amount of classes to graduate by their final year. Having to be in such a difficult position and only being able to attend morning or night school can make it harder to get these classes done on time. This will only make it stressful, and discourage students to get the classes done by the time of graduation. Not only do some seniors have jobs after school but having to attend a full day of school, and either morning or night school can be tiring and overwhelming. Overdoing yourself can also decrease the amount of people that pass their classes because of the reason that they have to much to get done in a matter of one school year,so allowing students to do some classes online will make it easier for more students to graduate.

The idea of online classes might sound difficult for some students because they tend to learn better face to face. Schools can offer virtual teaching lessons for those who have an issue with attending all their classes at school and learn better by someone verbally explaining each concept to them. Not all students have computers at home which is understanding, in order for students to complete online classes from home they will need a computer,schools can offer students a borrowed computer or laptop in order for them to participate in online classes. Schools can Introduce a system where they provide for those who need the help of obtaining a computer and to still be able to do their classes from home. By providing for those who need the computers, students will not be held back from the idea of doing classes from home just because they dont own a computer.

Having the choice of doing classes from home can be very beneficial to students. This gives students the opportunity to complete more classes and actually do them without having the excuse of being absent to school. Given the chance of doing classes from home can increase the passing levels for more classes. The idea of doing classes from home can be helpful for students who need it, and encourage students who need the option of at home classes to actually get these classes done from home. I think all schools should have an option that allows students to do classes from home.

638D7F913AAB,"Do you think the greatest accomplishment in the world is to be yourself in a world that is trying to change the person you are?, because I do not think people should change themself ever for what god brought us in the world for who we are and not changing ourself for others. So yes, I agree with Emerson statement about individuality, because people in this world are trying to change themselfs for others or just changing themselfs because they dont like themselfs for who they are. There are so many reasons why I agree with this statement especially in today's society that most people in this world are changging themselfs for someone else. I don't agree with the fact that people have the courage to change for others, because in any case they should just be thereselfs and love them for who they are, is the greatest accomplishment and feeling ever.

It is the greatest accomplishment because of the feeling that you loved yourself and secceeded without someone bringing you down and making you change yourself is the best feeling to feel. Otherwise the people who are trying to bring you down are winning and you are giving them the power that they should not have. In today's generation with all the social media we have people that have been rude and comment someting bad to make you feel bad about yourself and then some people change themself just because of a comment that could hurt someone. But if you can secceed people will leave you alone, because they know you will not listen to the rude comments you would recive and there just wasting there time. So then you have the power and accomplished the negetivity that people are trying to change yourself.

Also being yourself does not mean you wont have mistakes because everyone does and that is okay just without you changging yourself and accomplishing thing is the best part of life. It is okay to have mistakes because everyone learns from them and next thing they will do better then the last time they did something bad or had a mistake. People will go through tough times but it does not mean you should automatically change yourself for that. Everyone goes threw a situation that they probebly think they hate themself and wanna change the person they are, but I think that is wrong and they should be thereselfs and understand that everything will be alright at the end without them trying to change themselfs.

In my opinion I do not think that changing yourself will help with anything and I think it would probebly make things worst. LIke for an example if you change yourself nothing is gonna happend just you letting yourself down and changing who you are that should not have been in that situation. Also people would most likely notice and ask why you change yourself and that would bring back memories and make you go back in time and see why you change yourself. But if you dont change yourslef no one would know and wont bring up any badly past back memories. Also mistakes can happend and if you change yourself and go back and see old pictuers of you of how you used to be you might not like for who you are now and you cant go back because you change yourself for someone you did not want to be I mean you could always try but why try after you did it and cant go back.

So just be you and do not change for others who are constantly trying to make you something else who it is'nt you. It is such an amazing feeling and more people in this world would be great if they would'nt change for someone else because they would get the confidence and not worrying about what others has to say about them. People would most likely be so positive if they would be themself and not changing constantly or ever themselfs for people who are ignorent. People who love you would never say to change the person you are because that is just wrong and they know that they would not want to lose you as the person you are. So in all saying that everyone should not change and be themselfs in a world that is constantly trying to change them.

Technology may be good way to finish things quicker, but the stuff online that people put can be very cruel and hurt people's feelings. Some people dont think it could be serious, but it is. Technology does have a negative effect on people's lives because there's random people online asking for your personal information and also telling you harsh things without even knowing the person.

Everyone is using technology now a days, even kids. Parents say its a great way to entertain kids, but little kids don't really know what they're doing. Kids are most likely on youtube watching videos, but inappropriate stuff can pop up. Aslo happens to teenagers. Ever been online and people start texting you? They may ask for some personal information. For example, where do you live, do you want to meet up, or they even might want to rob you, ask for your card information. Some people dont think about the consquences and give out their information without thinking. You're putting yourself at danger without you even knowing it.

Social media is extremly popular all over the world. Snapchat, instagram, and twitter is what teenagers use, well even adults use it too. Using these apps can be fun because you talk to your friends and also share pictures, but it can also be a bit risky. You're probably wondering why? Well there's people who may ask for inappropriate pictures on snapchat and then screenshot it. Teenagers are probably thinking,

""oh I trust him or her,"" but next thing you know they're making a fake instagram to expose your pictures. There's people commenting below very mean things, find out who it is, and start calling them names. For example, hoe, slut, and whore. People may say it to play around, but they never know how the other person will feel. This can lead them to not wanting to be in this world anymore. It's also called cyber bullying and it's a very serious matter.

Technology can also be a positive effect on people's lives because you can meet new people, work gets done faster, and you can find out everything online. In this generation, everything is about technology. People say, ""I can't live without my phone."" It's all fun and games to have a phone and communicate with your peers. Parents think it's good to have a phone, ipad, or laptop until they get addicted to it though. Especially teens, they try to hide things from their parents. Technology does effect peoples lives in a negative way. People can commit suicide, or they can be depressed and may think of harming themselves. It brings their self confidence down. believe or not there is cruel people in this world and have no idea the harm their causing for others.

Technology has a big impacted in our lives and it's getting worse. People are getting cyber bullied and at school bullied for what's online. We need to stop this because it just gets worse and worse. We need to have safer sites. People should be able to feel safe when using technology. Technology has had a negative effect in people's lives and it needs to stop.

DEDCC703F6FC,"Some school districts offer programs that allow high students to gradute in three years instead of the traditional four years. In my opinion, I feel like it is a good idea for some school districts to allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years.

The reason on why I feel like it is a good idea for students to graduate early is for Job oppurtunity, Entering college early and also Moving other places and starting a whole new life without no worries on education no more. Job oppurtunity's will help you out to save money, working on what you like doing and also find some jobs can help you get into college if you are interested. For example, I am studying about autotechnology and it is my second year doing it. My plans are to continue working on cars and hopefully find a job at a dealership so I can learn enough at college.

Another reason on why I feel like allowing students to graduate in three years instead of four is so that they can start off there future earlier than others by attending college. Entering college early is a good thing because you have some time to pick and decide on what you might want to study and learn about so you can get your masters on it or so that you can finish early and move onto what's next on your accomplishments in life. My school has the option to do Dual Enrollment which basically means starting college already and getting already college credits and still having to be in high school.

Finally, another reason on why I feel like graduating high school earlier than others is to have the chance to move to another country or state and start a brand new. Starting a brand new life can become very hard and very stressful. Starting a new life moving somewhere else means finding a better job oppurtunity, finding a olace to live in your budjet and also finding new people to hang around with but in my opinion at the end it will all be worth it. Some students are already looking somewhere to move on there own or with a roomate because they might be having problems at home that they don't want to deal with. At the same time of moving to another place you have to make sure that you are ready on what's about to come into your life. For example, paying bills, paying rent, house supplies and also if you have a vehicle make sure that your payments are on time.

The place I would like to visit is Russian. I would like to visit Russia because first it is largest country in the world, second Russia has a lot of architecture that I would like to see, and lastly I want to see and try different types of food that Russian people eat every day.

Russia is one of the largest countries in the world. If you will compare Russia and non-planet Pluto Russia will be bigger than Pluto. Now I will compare Russia and other countries. If you would be able to put one country on top of the Russia you would be able to put two United States and still some place would left. You could put China, North Korea, South Korea, and Japan. Lastly the biggest amount of one countries you could put on top of Russia is you would be able to put about five-hundred of Switzerland and you still would have some place left. But without all of those countries Russia is very big country with a lot of different natural resources and a lot of very smart and kind people.

Russia has a long history and all the way through the time that Russia was created people were creating different types of architecture. I will tell you about what I would like to see. I would like to see Kremlin on the Red Square, to see Red Square, to see different types of very popular Orthodox Churches. In Generic_City I would like to Hermitage, Russian Museum, and lastly i would like to see different types of old castles that Tzars was living in.

Because I like opera I would like to see opera theaters and to listen singers the professional way they singing Russian opera.

When I will be in Russia want to try different types of Russian traditional food. Borsch is traditional soup, Halva is traditional desert, traditional Russian bread, Russia pie, Pancakes, and lastly Russian sour cream. But also I want to compare different types of food that you can buy in United States like chips, candies, and different types of soda.

Some students need time to work to help their parents to pay bills or pay rent. Some of the students need to take care his little brother or sister while his parents work.

Students need time to play sports like soccer they need time to practice more than usual. Need time to get out early from the sport they get home early to do their homework. Study for any test they have or something they need to do from school. They might need time to do shores at home. Some need time to take care of their brothers or sisters when their parents are not at home.

Probably their mom and dad work and they can't stay home and take care of their children. They need their big son that goes to school to get out of school early to take care of his little brother or sisters. While his parents work really hard to get money pay bills get more money they might really need a lot of money so they need to work really hard. They might work really late so the student needs to stay home and take care of the children do shores take care of the house. He probably needs to do everything at home like cook for his little brothers.

Maybe the student needs to work to help his mother to pay bills pay rent. Help her with the food probably she is single and she has like 5 sons. She might really work hard to get everything that they need so the student needs to help his mom to pay something. He can help pay things that she don't have to worry anymore because her son will help her to pay that. She won't have to worry to much about working really hard and think that if she don't work she's going to get kicked out of her house because she missed to pay her rent.

I disagree with that because we the students need more time. We need less time at school instead of adding an hour and a half they should take one hour off the school. For we can get more time to do our things to play sports or to help our parents with things they need help. Help them make sure they don't worry to much about money.

How do people use math every single day you may ask. When you go to the super market to buy food, the register has to add all the food that you bought and they even have to add taxes. How about when you go shopping in the mall with some friends. When some is looking for a job they even have to find out how much is the salary. When your parents pay water bills and taxes, they have to pay the perfect amount of money. If your doing a party you have to find how much money your wasting. In your school you have to use math in mostly all your subject. In science you have find out how much of a mass is in a cup of water then subtract it from the cup to find the mass of water. For history the president has to find out about expensive's and the taxes that each citizens is paying. If you have a hobby or have talents to do an activity you even use math. In theater arts you have to measure and subtract where the lights are hitting and you have to find the perfect angel. In baking you have to add your ingredients and weight it to find it's mass.

When you cook don't tell me you just put random stuff in your pot. You have to find the perfect amount to feed the people you are feeding.

However several kid's don't like math but they could try it in a fun way. Many children complain about math being to hard or just being boring. I have found a way to make it exciting for kids. They could be playing games or just pretending to buy stuff, like doing a little play that won't cost money. If a student likes painting give them a coloring book that has math in it. Dancing and music is the same thing like coloring. In music you can count how many strings a violin has and compare it to another instrument that is in the violin family. You can watch a funny video that is related to math, you can watch it in your home or in school. Go on a field trip that will be free or that won't cost that much money.

If a student is struggling in math help or show them a way to do it. A kid's classmates or friend could help them in math. They can use math websites like racing cars for boys and coloring games for girls. If they are still struggling then ask there parents if they can stay or to get them a tutor after school. Find them a easier and understandable way to teach them math. The child's teacher can even play fun games with her students like Kahoot,Quizlet live, or even Pear Deck. You can give out prizes like candy or sticker's, that will probably get them more exciting.

876B9CDDC1FC,"I donr undertan why people is stupid to ''act' as someone else. From my point of view, is so stupid. Also, there is Latinos who copy other Latino's accent trying to be cool or staff, and it's not make sense, because that means they do not love their own country and do not have self-steem. Because with that they're showing someone who is not themselves. And the most stupid thing is when they show some love to their country and apparent like nothing happen. That means being doble face. I do not like that kind of people. However, that's no the only thing. People start to follow what someone else say. For example, if someone say that they like short hair, someone else do it to feel a little bit of atention.

My uncle now files tax people get pay a lots;

when people do not know how files tax they came to him files for them by that he was successful because he accomplish more if always doing somethings now he has own company where people work for him. He always advisory worker in order for you to successful always do somethings new. This show that it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something.

Ring Ring everyone rushes to the halls to get on their bus to go home. They think of all the things they can do when they get home. like fly a kit or playing football, not thinking about school in the sliest. Now take one and a half hours of those students' free time away from them. This may be a realty if the school board gets there way.

If I asked students if they wanted one and a half hours added to there school day they most of them would say no. People's toughs may vary when it comes to a topic like this. I would only approve one and a half hours being added if school gets a later start time. As a student my self I would say that exercise is very important, but extending school time will take from that time. Most high schools end at three o'clock, if the board adds one and a half hours schools will end four thirty p. m.

This may be a good thing because students will have more time to learn instead of of doing nothing. Some children are worst of then others some are homeless and some are with out parents this would be a good time to learn so they could be better off. Parents that work nine to five jobs wont have to worry about leaving there child unsupervised. They will be more increases in work ethic and discipline. Less homework will be assigned because the student will have more time in there classes.

The reason I disagree is because this would hurt not only the student but also the local government's economy and the tax payers. If the teachers work more hours then they will have to be payed more money. if the local government has to pay them more money then there going to tax more people. That means that there income tax will be higher. Tax payers would boycott the the additional tax that comes with the one and a half hour change.

4ED60E89D535,"Teens Shoud Have a Curfew

Most nights, teens like to hang out and spend quality time with their friends and family. Which then results, or could result in serious problems. It could take a tole on teenagers education. It could lead to teens being hurt or killed. And it could also reduce the amount of sleep teenagers get before waking up and going to high school. making a curfew though could help reduce all of these problems that could happen to teenagers that are out at night.

Teenagers love to go out at night with their friends or family. They either go out to parties and have a good time or they just go hang out and talk. Either way, doing any of those choices waste lots of time that they could be using to study or finish up work that they have from school. Which could then lead them to staying up all night finishing their work just because they wanted to go and hang out with friends and family. Sometimes they don't even finish their school work cause they either came home to late or were just to tired to do any work at all. This could also lead to teenagers having a lack of sleep which could lower their concentration at school and could even lead to them falling asleep during class. Having a curfew though could lead to teens finishing their work earlier and going to sleep earlier.

That's why teenagers should have a curfew to increase their sleep and to give them time to finish up any work they have instead of being out at night.

Night time is when all the gang members, rapist, drug addicts, and drug dealers tend to come out because their is fewer people and since its harder for people to see. Which then makes it easy for them to steal any jewelry or money, kill any random human, or kidnap people for their own sexual use. Kids and teenagers are mostly the targets since they're easier to go for. Which would make the curfew for teenagers a excellent adoption. Since it would lower the chance of teens being seriously injured or killed in any way possible by gangs, rapist, drug addicts, or drug dealers.

Some people could disagree with the idea of teens having a curfew and say that, the way teenagers relax and forget about stress is by going out at night and having fun. But in that case teenagers would just be giving them selves more stress then they already contain. The reason behind it is because they wold be avoiding all their work that they have to complete for school, while at the same time getting more work every day they go to school. So by having a curfew it would force teens to finish up their school work giving them less work and less stress about school. If they still decide not to do their school work that would just mean that they're putting themselves up for failure instead of success. That's why having a curfew would be more helpful for teenagers instead of not having a curfew at all for teenagers.

To recap, curfew helps teenagers a lot more then you think. It reduces the murder count at night and helps cops relax more knowing no teenagers are in danger. It also helps teenagers get a lot more amount of rest before going to school. Which would help them be more awake during their classes. It also helps improve studnets education by forcing students to finish up their school work instead of going outside at night to parties or just to spend time talking to friends and family.

183C0C0BAA13,"Think about the benefits of working with a group or working alone. Which do you feel is more beneficial? I think that working alone is better than work with a group because nobody can get mad if someone else does not work, you can do your work in your own way, and you will have your own opinion about what you are doing.

Firstly, nobody can get mad if someone else does not work. When people are working with a group, there are some people who does not work at all. If there is someone that does not work in the group, all the members of the group will get mad. For example, in math class the teacher use to tell us that we can work in groups, but I have some friend that the only thing that they do during I work is talk. When I finish with all the work, they ask me for the answers. When that happen I get mad, and that is the same situation that any group will have.

Secondly, you can do your work in your own way. If you work with a group, there are going to be more than one person. Not everyone likes to work in the same way that you do. In a group, people start doing things in their own way, and that is not going to work because all the work that the group make should look the same. Even when people are working in a presentation, they do their work different one to each other. For example, last semester the biology teacher gave the student the final exam, and she said that we can do it in partners. My friend and I decided that we can work together, but the next day he did not come to school. I started doing the final exam in my own way, and the next day he started helping me. The only things is that his work was completely different from mine, and the exam was not a success.

Finally, you will have your own opinion about what you are doing. Everyone have different point if view, and sometimes that make the work in group not a good decision. People will be telling you that you should do your work different or that what you are doing is not correct. When people start telling you that you are doing something wrong, you start thinking and feeling that you do not know how to do it or that you are wrong. To avoid this situation, is preferable to work alone and not with a group.

In conclusion, work with a group is not the best decision you can take. It is better if you work alone because nobody can get mad if someone else does not work, you can do your work in your own way, and you will have your own opinion about what you are doing. You are going to feel better if you do your work by yourself. Whenever you have any question, you can ask your teacher to make sure you are doing your work right.

0F7900292BB6,"Have you event been told that you had to chose a career before high school. I have, and I say we as young adult should pace ourselfs and not rush this important life decision so early. Because that decision de the person and the time, not important for take one career. Each young person has a decision to purse a career or not because it is optional.

First of all I disagree whit this idea, because young students are more like to listen what adults tell them to chose. That ends up on kinds chosen careers they dont want or like and in the long run it takes away their Dreams, money, and time. The kinds need more inspiration for that in future they take one career like: doctor, arquitec, teacher, and other carriers is good have one inspiration. Is good have persons that support in every time like Mom, family or dad. Because much young not listen the adult or not have support in the family for that reason they do not pursue a career.

Secondly us young adults need to expand our knowledge in the work field. Like for example we need to watch videos and have people already working their to explain How they work and ward they do. It would be a good idea to have two examples of people: a person who has ready finished his career and has work and money and the other, who does not finish his studies and asks for money in the street.

305EFA6DBBBF,"Do we choose our own character traits?

As the British naturalist and politican Jonh Lubbock wrote, ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" I certanly agree that everyone is capeable of choosing their own character trait, they are independent enough to have control over themselves', they're capeable to choose in what type of enviroment they want to be in, or how to react to bad or good circumtances, at the end of the day we all have the freedom to choose who, and what we want to be.

Jonh Lubbock wrote, ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.' everyone have the completly control over themselves, no matter how bad the circumtances may be or how tough a problem is, everyone will always be allow to choose either to smile or cry, to be positivee or negative for example;

My grandma, she's a 78 years old lady that have work her entire life, she's a very independent women who always says, ""If i don't do it, no one can make it as good as i can."" Always with a positive attitude, never sitting down, because she says that sitting down is a waste of time, and she have always been so energetic, until one day that sadly she had a really strong stroke in the middle of her brain that made her lose movement on half of her body, and her voice, her doctor told us that she was going to stay in a wheel chair for the rest of her life, it was hard to see someone so positive and with so much energy, in a wheel chair for the rest of her life, everyone was really shock and depressed about it including my mom, but even though my grandma knew what was going on her positive attitude never change, she took over the circumstances and she never gave up on herself she decided to be ""positive"", even though it was a rough time in life, this example helped me to see that everyone have their own control or they can choose who they want to be in the hard or easy times.

Everyone can have the freedom to choose the enviroment around them, how they wanna live, with who they wanna leave, people have the abilitly to understand when there are toxic people around them, to understand how much an enviroment can change the way they act, to understand that they can change the negative enviroment into a positive enviroment, everything in your character depends on your onw person, yes the enviroment that is around you can affect a lot on your character, affects on what you do in a daily base, but at the end of the day it alwasy depends on you, who you wanna be, who the people around you should make you feel, and how positive or negative it should be.

Having a reaction with other people around you can show them what your character is, it can show people your weakest part, and can shows them how dangerous or calm you can be, reactions are a really big part of our characters either if we have the control of them or not, how we react and how we respond depends on us, for a lot of people having their own character it's really hard, because of their negative or positive mood, sometimes we want to be or act like other people that we see at school, but that's like stealing their characters, at least but not last everyone have the freedom to choose what their character traits are or can be.

In conclusion everyone is free to choose what they character should be, no matter if they are going through a rough time or have the whole word agains them, theywill always have the chance of trying to be someone else character or build their own, but it will alwaysbe what they choose their character traits to be.

7EED34A43536,"Inside of each people always has the right and the wrong sides. That make they think if they should being themselves or not. If a person being themselves then they just want to do anything they know and do not care another person. However, they live in the modern world and have many things to worries. Although people have their own decision, people should not being themselves are great accomplishment because sometime they need to change and over time people have done the tasks they hate.

First of all, people have their own decision. So, we know that many people are accomplishment by their own decision but only for who are smart or brave challenge themselves. Some of them just live and do anything they like when they success. However, not being themselves should not change the physical world. For example, a man who has a dream that he can travel around the world. He always thinking about it but he can not. Because he know it is a modern world and has many things to do and worries. So, he put his dream on the side and focuses on the job. He hopes it will make his life better and can complete his dream later.

Also, sometime they need to change. Some people they never change their life, and they just live by the rules. Of course, they will feel boring and nonsense. They want to do with something else. For instance, a person who live with his family and he recognizes that he likes to become the doctor in the future because his family want it. Absolutely, he knows what he wants to do. But when he do this job for the long times and he feels that he does not has more interest. Everyday, he is so busy and he does not has times for his family and himself. So, he knows work to lives, not lives to work. After thinking about that, he wants to do the jobs that makes him comfortable and can enjoy the wonderful life.

In addition, over time people have done the tasks they hate. Task is the mission from the boss give them to completing. So, they force to finish it while they do not like. When they go out to work they need to follow all the rules of the life. Also, they can not do anything they like while living with their family before. For example, a trainee person who is young and do not have an experience in the job. Because he just graduation and he wants to become the employer in this company. So, he will manage by the marketing manager and he so happy about that. For the first day, the manager just wants him to do some work likes buy the coffee, copy papers... And he thinks it will better for the next day but the manager just gives him these jobs and no more. So, he hates it but he never give up because it is the rules of life. He recognizes that help him too much to create more skills and learn more experiences.

Thus, people should not being themselves are great accomplishment. So, people should not being themselves because they do not know exactly about themselves. Some people want to become another one to success. When they look at another people they can learn more lessons and experiences in life. Sometimes, they need to change to know the outside of the world have more fun than if they just stay at one place.

Setting our aim too high and falling short is more important because we feel better knowing that we did our best and we can discover new things that maybe we never thought to do.

First, we feel better knowing that we did our best to make are goals,even that is not at all like we thought. When I was 11 years old and I used to play soccer, and one of my goal was to win play in a proffesional soccer team and win trophies,even that I did play for a proffesional soccer team I won many trophies. Trying to make real the goals that we used to had when we were young make us to feel proud and confident of ourselves because we never get up, always fough to do it.

Another reason, when we make our goals, even that maybe we just complete tha half of our goals;we discover new things that maybe we did not know that we can made. For example, if my dream was to be a master chef, and I work at place where a cook food to helping homeless. So, I realized that I can make my goal helping other people. When my brother was a kid, his dream was to travel around the world;even that he is pilot and only go to airport, he meet his fiance in his job. Some people may say that complete only the half of our challenging goals make us disappoined of ourselves because we did not complete. However, copmplete a challenging goals make us proud of ourselves because we are people who worked really hard and we discover many things that maybe others will never do.

Overall, we learn more doing challenging goals in our life than doing small goals that maybe everyone can do essaly.

7D98C85F9223,"Has the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had positive or negative effects on people's lives? Yes, people using technology on everyday bases can have negative effects on thier lives. For example, looking into your screen for long period of time can have negative effects on your eyes. Being on your phone everyday limits your time of socialing and having regular converstion with other people. technology can make you develop an ediction with your phone, video game, and computer making you unawere with what's happeing around the world. eventhoght technology has negative effects on you, sometimes technology can have positive effects on you and your everyday life.

For example, technology can help you keep and complite taskes in your everyday life. using your phone can alow you to do things like: order clothes, buy eddibles, talk with family and friends all over the world, watch movies, listin to music, playing games, remembering birhdays, and things you have to do in your long term plan. Getting things done just by your phone can make your life easier and stress free. In some cases technology is used more then to just watch movies and remebering birthdays, its used to save lifes and make new inventions.

For instance, older people with health problems use technology everyday, they depend on technology to safe thier lives. The technology that they have can alert and get the help the person needs without the person having to call or touch anything. people around the worls are using technology to help and make cure for people with health issues. some are using technology to make new inventions such as, self driving cars to make the world a better and safe place.

For students technology is very helpful they can use it in school to take tests, quizes, and classwork. They can use it at home to do homework and study. use it to reserch and watch visualy watch videos to help them understand things they don't know. help them communicate with teachers and other helpful resorces online. For home schooled students technology is very helpful, beacuse some student are able to learn and understand better if they got lessons online than in a classroom.

Moreover, technology is a very helpful thing it might have negative effects on you and your life if you use it in the wrong way but its very helpful in some cases, and people actually need technology to learn and live.

Desagree:. Other school don't offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home because that's not great way to learn.

1: Students wouldn't benefit being able to attend classes from home because if they don't understand something who can help them.

2: Distance learning is not the best way to learn because you need some school to learn what you need to know like student that you are.

3: If you take classes from home you can learn but if you take the classes direcly from some school thatone is the best way that you to learn.

Other school don't offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home because that's not great way to learn because students wouldn't benefit being able to attend classes from home because if they don't understand something who can help them, distance learning is not the best way to learn because you need some school to learn what you need to know like student that you are and If you take classes from home you can learn but if you take the classes direcly from some school thatone is the best way that you to learn.

Some school offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way online or video conferencing because for some students that's the best way to take their classes but for other student is not the best way because some student have to work after school and they have other responsabilities to do like the people who came to this country from another country and don't live with their parents this guys have to work and study at the time so that's why I think is not benefit to attend classes at home. For example the people who came to this country, they came for a better future, better opportunities and they need to learn a new languaje and that's not easy for everybady some people learn very quickly but other people not.

calsses by way online that's great for some student because they have a great idea and reasons to take classes from home for example some student have child and they have to care about their baby's so they can't go to school for them that's a great opportunuty to study and do what they want, this people just need motivation to keep going and they can gain their goals.

I think students they don't be benefit attend classes from home because at home they have too many things that can be disctracte for them with things like electronic devices, or persons like childrens, and any other distract thing.

Video conferencing that's good form to learn for some people who want to attend classes from home but if you have any question or any dude you can't ask to this video that's why I thing that the best way to learn is going to school and work hard every day to do and study what we want to do in the future, we have our future in our hand if we do any bad thing some day we pay for that, always we have to think and be sure for what we want and do. in this life everything the we do to somebody good or but someday that thing comeback to you and there woud you feel what other people someday fool for your foult.

755EC4B2172D,"First Impressions

Do you agree or disagree that it's impossible to change your first impressions? I believe that you can change you first impressions, But not everyone is the same some people think differently, That its impossible to change your first impression. Im going to write a prompt showing my point of view and other's point of view to see if it is impossible to change your first impression.

My point of view is that I agree that you can change your first impressions, But it matter on the person you're first meeting. For example your going on a date with a girl you just started to talk to, But only through the phone so y'all decide to meet up and go out to dinner. let's say you being planning the perfect date the whole day, But then you get to the date and something goes wrong like you get nervous and say something stupid and she gets mad and leaves and you think it's all over but it's really not. You need to text her and say sorry tell her that you were nervous and also tell her that you want to forget is this all happen and start over by having another date and if she agree there you go you change your first impressions. Another reason why I agree to changing first impressions cause I had done it before. One day this girl came up to me and said why you always looking mad I told her what is she talking about I am mostly happy all the time, She said I don't know its just you look mad and mean every time I see you. I told her im not mean ,so we started to talk more and she got to know me better for who i am happy,kind and nice. See what I am talking about it's not hard to change your first impressions.

Other peoples point of view see it differently,They see it as once you mess up your first impressions you can't change it. You might as well move on and give up,But like I said before it matter on the other person to,If they disagree then yeah you can't change your first impressions,But for me I don't like to give up easily but other people are different. People need to stop giving up just cause they messed up he first time. you can get a redo it's not the end push for what you want. I had almost given up on someone cause i thought I messed up but i didn't give up I tried one more time and it work she turn out to be the love of my life so one day someone had told me that the girl had a crush on me I thought she was really cute too but I thought there was no way I was going to date her she was way out of my league so I tried to be someone else that wasn't me but that didn't work I was lucky she already knew how I was so she gave to a another chance on my first impressions and it worked we have been dating for 1 year and 4 months now but not everyone gets lucky and find someone that is willing to give second chance.

In conclusion I still believed that you can change your first impressions but it matter on the other person too, If they agree or disagree on giving you another shot on your first impressions, So you shouldn't give up. Just cause you messed up on your first impression. I hope this changes the mind of peoples that disagree that they can change their first impressions.

23FC0A3DF4C9,"In my opinion, I do believe that it should be an elective classes for students to take art, drama, and music classes because it has nothing to do with our education. It won't help us in the future because all you need to learn is how to get a good job, pay for bill and electricity, food, gas, and water. It has nothing to do with our and it should be optional for students to take any art classes whenever they like the class and the second reason is that students might not like the classes because they will be not be interested and will be bored because art is really not their thing. Students like to listen to music, party, go on social media, sports, video games, talking to friends, and being cool. But they don't want to sit in class with a bunch of nerds that paint, make clay and draw. Students should not be required to take a class they don't like. It should be optional just like band class. Some students might fail the class because they either don't like being there and just skip the class or they're not that good at making clay or drawing. For drama it should be optional too since all you do is make an act and speech and it has nothing to do in students futures. Music class is what students will find most interesting but it has nothing to do with students futures either.

DEB6DD3E13D8,"Yes I agree with the principal. I agreed because students need to have at least 30 minuets out side. Students should also be a part of an activity in there school because it is very fun. The principal said that you have to at least do one activity. It is good for you if you stay after school to do activities like sports or work on the year book you can also work on your homework if you need help. It is good for you because you get to learn new things about your school and also can represent your school you can also stay in shape.

Most of the students in the school dont do any thing because they are to lazy or they have to take care of there siblings.

I had a lot of fun when I was doing actives after school because I got to get away from my sisters and my mom because my mom always cleans and it annoys me because right when I get back from school my mom says go clean your room, clean the living room, go clean the bathroom and when I am done I barely had time to do my homework.

Some activities can help you in the future because you can get to go to college for free if you are good student and have good grades and know how to play a sport.

A7C8AEE8D3BE,"Hello Sr. Principal the motive because I'm writing this note is to say the next stuff

The students of my school are icomfortable about the cafeteria the food many students don't want to eat the food the they are taking beacause they sayd bafore that pizza have a lot ingredients that have to much calories to get fat and many food that they don't like to eat because they wan to be healthy in theyr life and have a good and have a good nutrition for the rest of theyr life they want to change tne menu fast food to others food more healthy like ensalad of any aech of the life.

1. Reason

''They should like it eat want they want to eat so is thats whay that i writing this note to let you know what's going on with students for the food in the school beacuse the students are worry abput theyr life and they to be strong and haealty for each situation that they are food fats food they trying to protect the blood and hearth beause if they don'n eat well they literally theyr going to get sick and they don't want to be sick.

2. Reason

""The pricipal Sr. have to act to change the food for have a god health fo every students and be gentle to respond this note from estudent to the principal of school to change the food that they don't want to eat and have note to start and get some many food that the studente wanted.

3. Reason

I just want to start this letter by telling you a little bit more about my interest towards your company . As a matter of fact, the day I heard about the oportunities our school were giving to some students to be able to visit some companies. I absolutely want it participate, Because I want to develope more practice and skills about the job I would want to have when I get out of Collage .

Farther more, I'm very interest to work for a Microsoft company that has being my dreams sinse the day I started using computers and I would want it create something that can help others and create new technology for future Generations. However in my school theres not a lot of programs or clases about computer management or software programing, that could help me and other students to improve our nolage about computer Software. I would want to learn more and get more experience about crearting and fixing computers.

For sure woking at a Microsoft company is what I want to do for a living. Also allowing me to come and visit one of the companies would help me undertand what I'm going to be facing in the future when I start working for a big company

For example, what is exactly the job I'm going to be doing or what job I be able do enjoy doing , or what is going to take to get there etc.

If you allow me this oportunity I can show you my skills and you can see and judge me by my job or what I can do. I belive I can be caplabe to do very creative work and come up with ideas in a matter of seconds to improve new producs. And this oportunity can help me figure out what other type of work i can be able to do.

I appreciate the oppotunities your companies are giving to our school and other schools in general, but now I would want to know if you could give me chace and the privilege to come to one of your companies and learn more about Microsoft Programing and computers.

F13C7EC54868,"I agree that the programs that allow students to graduate in three years, will be a perfect idea and everyone must like this. As i know some students really need to graduated early some of them need, to help their parents with some money. It's a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college early.

Some districts are offering programs for students ; for example they are allowing them to graduated in three years some students need to help their parents with some money. Also they want to graduate early because of college this programs really help students and high school.

Students who follow all this plans they have to be persistent to graduate in three years. To illustrated students wants this programs to be able to have the things that they want ; for example buy a car buy some clothes. Also students enjoy to hang out with friends so if they graduated early, they will work and have some money to buy what do they want. Students must follow all this plans to see the results.

While some people think that it's a good idea for students to finish high school and three years to enter college early, others argue that students don't learn enough in three years. There are several's ideas that improve this such as they didn't focus in learn more about assessments. people think that they don't learn enough in three years, they missed classes that they might need in the future; for example construction class we don't know if one day we are going to work in construction then we will need some skills in that job . Also advanced PE we are going to needed it for our healthy students need to know more about other classes that they might need it in the future.

I think it's a perfect idea for the students who wants to get a diploma in three years. Students need to work to help their parents for example pay the bills and all that.

I feel like problems can give us chances to redeem ourself and for us to try our besto to over lap those problems in the future and present. maybe sometimes when try your best you fail but I say alwats try your best even in th darkest time.

When he sai "" A problem is a chance to try your best"" He saying a problem is when can try your best and over lap it so you can prove people you don't fall easy. problems can help a lot when you over lap them you know what too do if it happens again. Its good to learb from past mitakes because and know not too do that again or mess up. If you can learn from problems can able to not mess again. I always try my best no matter the place,sport or school subject I got to go beyond. when you cause a problem you got a chance prove yourself. always be your best and alwasy try your best because laziness is not going get you any where in life. I geuss a problem could give you a chance to do your best, but why should a problem give you a chance when you always have to be at your best because you dont anything can happen. when he said "" A problem is a chance for you try your best"" his saying when something bad happens its your chance to try your best. I agree because most people when there in trouble or in tight place they try ther best to get over it and move on so I agree with that. sometimes when do try your best it doesnt work well I say learn from those mistakes and try again and again till you over pass it. Things happen thyats way it is and alway give it all you have and good results will happen not to give up either too. I have learned that being lazy and not trying does not get you any where or give you anything so always try your best even if its hard at least try and if you fail do it over and over till your the best at it. For me I know If i put my mind too something i will able to do anything and I will be best at it and I always try my best no matter the cause. If going threw something rule number one is not give up you give up its game over no where to go, always try something knew master new things so you will never have a problem again. In my opinion I say patience is the key everything always wait and watch and learn dont mess up. always be prepared for problems and too not give up because it will be chance for you to show your best.

I also argree because problems give you chance to try your best and hardest and always be ready for anything. problems can be easy or hard but dont give try your best and learn from it so you wont mess up again. be ready because at of the day anything can happen always be prepared no matter what.

BA6FC6ECE68E,"Some school districts have been offering programs that are allowing high school students to graduate a year early instead of the regular four years. In my opinion most students who agree with this and actually want to graduate a year early just do it to get school out of their way. They choose to take courses in the summer than a nice trip to a beach or hang out with some friends. I mean who wouldn't want to graduate a year early right? but in the end it's not even worth it.

I know that school may not be all fun and games but all that education and knowledge sure does take you far in life. Graduating a year earlier than your other classmates doesn't make you more than them, it doesn't make any student seem smart, it's just them taking the short cut to end school.

I believe it isn't a good idea for students to graduate a year early. I say this because senior year just brings more new experiences to your life. Also you get more opportunities to get a little taste of a few colleges when they come to the schools. You get help with your resume's, and just things that prepare you for a good future. Senior year is the ""best"" year as some students say. Graduating a year early, just makes you miss all those nice and fun experiences with friends, including the activities the school does that last year. Some students may not agree with this but senior year just gives you that extra push into making your future better. The last year of high school is like the guide to the beginning of your new life as an adult with more goals to be accomplished.

Another reason why I dont think it's a good idea for students to just take the ""easy""way out is because some students just do it to end their school life. I believe that the students who'd want to graduate a year earlier would be the ones who skip class, don't do their work, are always late to school and so on ,but to make it clear I was just referring to the bad influenced kids. High school isn't a race and neither is who has the best things in life because those you earn them by your hard work. Some students end up not even going to college, they just go straight into the workforce. Being one of those students who get to graduate a year early, it literally doesn't make you cool. I personally think that going straight to the workforce isn't the best option because to be honest, they just end up working in a Chick-fil-A, McDonalds, Burger King and all those jobs that don't even pay well. An education can get you a job! A job that'll pay you well and something that you know you'll have as a secure job and not having to change every other month or every three months.

For those students who are planning on finishing high school in three years they must have a plan whether or not they plan on still getting into a college. If some of those students still plan on going to college then they should be aware that some colleges may expect four years of high school. Also colleges may look on your school record and just see the type of person you were and may not accept you. All this coming to a close that not all colleges will be acceptable of you only having to do three years of high school. For those who don't plan on going to college, they have to have a better plan for them to survive in the real life. Some students just don't take the school serious but only if they knew that, that's the key for them to open to get to their future.

If I were agree with school districts allowing students to finish school a year early, I'd think about the positive side it has. I believe that some students may actually do it because they love school that much that they'd want to get a head start with their career. That's good I'm not saying it's bad, it's just something I wouldn't do. Students who are more than prepared should be the ones graduating early. Only students who have had perfect attendance and do their work and get good grades should only get that opportunity.

In conclusion, school districts should not allow high school kids to graduate a year early. They have to earn it and demonstrate their hard work. Senior year is the last little push a high school student gets before starting a new chapter of their life.

FAB189F7E4DF,"Have you ever do something bad in your life , and your friends influence you to do it ? well everybody has two types of friend one with good behavior and the other with bad behavior. But the teenagers of this time never think in consequences when they are following bad examples. So I believe that a good example by your own behavior is the best way to infuence other people because people learn things by examples, or if you get together with somebody who is not a good influence for you believe or not your are going to learn what he does. People is always around you they are always looking what you do and they are criticizing your actions.

My first reason is because good behavior is the best way to influence people because if you are a smart person, educated , and happy your are going to be a example for other people and they might said that they want to be like you. Many teenagers has ruin their life for following bad influences. People can said that we are old enough to know what is good or wrong but we never think from what is coming. The world is full of bad person and some people would ask their self, why there's too many bad people in this world? the answer is because people is influencing others to do bad stuffs. If human wants a better world for their kids they have to be good influences, good examples to the new generation that is coming.

In my own experience I have seen friends and relatives that has ruin their life for getting together with people that is a bad influence for them. Is really sad when you see somebody that is in jail or dead for following bad examples by having bad friends. When you are following a bad example that person never is going to tell you what are the consequences. As you can see babies when they are in the age of learning new things they do what their parents do or what they teach them to do. Adults and teenagers are a little bit different because not all the time we do what people tell us to do, but we always end up learning something of that person.

People is always criticizing so if you don't want to that happen be a good example. Being a good influence people would trust in you, but being the opposite of that nobody would trust in you. And when we realize is too late because the people you appreciate are separating from you for been a bad influence for others or maybe for them. My grandma always said , "" what you crop, you would sow."" For me those phrases mean a lot because being a good example or having a good behavior will take you to succeed in life , and is not just that there are many ways to succeed in life too.

For these reasons I believe that a good example is the best way to influence others so the people that is learning or looking what you do can learn good things about you and by that wat can trust in you.

You are changing school policy so student that have a C average can not participate in sports or other activities unless the students have at least a B average .I think that students that have a C average should at least have an extra class that they need help in so they can pull up their grades up so the students can participate in sports or activities. If the teachers of the student think that they are working hard to bring their grades up at least the principal should give the students 30 minutes of free time on the activities or sports they want to participate in.

If some younger student doesn't feel good or he needs help a older student can help him. But, This program can benefit and not benefit the students.

One reason why this program can benefit younger students is because older students are going to assist them. Also, younger students can assist the older students. If one of the younger student needs help a older student is going to be available to assist the younger student.

AF4A2E8AD2A5,"Some people argue that working in a group has more benefits then working working alone. Some people also argue that working alone has more benefits then working in a group. Working alone is more beneficial the working in a group because, if one person in the group does not come to school the group will be short a person, if a member in the group does not care about the project, and not everyone is going to agree with each others ideas and opinions.

If a member in the group does not come to school the group will fall behind and not turn the work on time. if a person in the group is sick with a virus they would have to miss school and miss work on the project and that would hold back the rest of the group from turning in the project on time. When being put with someone who does not come to school often will cause stress on the rest of the group and also a delay. When working alone the worry of a group member not coming to school is not a thing because its alone.

When someone in the group does not care about the work the group will be held back because then more work would have to be done by the others. When being put with someone who does not care is hard because only the rest of the group is doing the work and putting in effort. Working in a group would also not be fun because you have someone who is not doing anything. When the group is working the one who does not care would be sleeping or on their phone. When working alone there is none of this to worry about because it is a independent assignment.

When working in a group not everyone is going to agree with each other on the same ideas. If one person says they do not like that idea, the group would have to take time and all agree on something as a group. Agreeing on something would take up to one or two classes and that would waste a lot of time and put the project behind. When working alone there is not agreeing on anything, it is whatever that person chooses.

Working in a group it would be more fun but when working alone more work can be done. Being pared with friends is nice but the amount of work able to get done when alone is a lot more.

4F35BA561593,"Some people ask if it is better to work with a group or alone? Everyone has different opinions about the benefits of working in a group or working alone, some people prefer working alone and others prefer working in groups. I believe that the best way for the people to improve is by working in groups because they learn more and understand better.

First, working in groups help the people to improve in school or at work because they learn new things. For example, listening other ideas and points of view from their partners. One day my English teacher make groups of four in class and gave each group a piece of paper, then he put some questions in his board and told us that we need it to answer them as a group, when we finish the teacher told us that we were going to discuss it, then when each group discuss their answers with the class we all realized that each group had different opinions, ideas, and points of view. Each group learn something new from each other.

""Everyday we all learn new things in life"".

Second, working in groups help the people improve because they will understand better. For example, asking their partners if they have a question or didn't understand really well. My history teacher gave the class an assignment that we need it to completed by the end of the class, when the teacher gave the instructions i didn't understand her really well, then i ask one of my partners if he could explained to me again in order for me to understand it, be able to give my opinions and help my group.

""We could do more if we all help each others"".

Many people believe that is better to work alone because they will concentrate more. For example, they will not get distracted with anyone and will finish the work faster. A friend of mine has always work alone because she said that when the people is working in groups they tend to start talking, distract others, don't do their work and by the end of the hour only got a couple of questions done. However, this argument is meaningless because if they don't understand really well, then they would not have a partner who could explained to them what they are doing. For example, not finish their work because they got stuck in a part. Not having someone to discuss the work with could be hard sometimes.

In conclusion, there's a lot of benefits when working with a group. Some of the others benefits that working in groups has are; making new friends, having the opportunity to learn more about your partner, and learn more about yourself. Having to work with someone is a good idea because you don't have a lot of pressure about having to finish the work on time or not having idea what to do. Even though some people say the opposite, i believe that working in groups is better than working alone.

1849B89A02D6,"Thomas Jefferson said its amazing how much is done if we work hard, do we accomplish by doing something or does doing nothing have a purpose? If we doing something everyday we could accomplish something like if you exercise every day with healthy meals you will be losing weight and burning calories, if we do not do nothing and don't take care of your self you'll gain weight, see stretch marks on your body or even get diagnosed by diabetes or even something even more serious like a stroke, heart attack, and organ failure.

Everyday people accomplish things for example: work people who work in construction have to work through some harsh conditions when its freezing or when its flaming hot. From my experience of working in construction I was a laborer working for ten hours, I as a laborer had to make sediment, mix for placing cinder blocks, carry buckets of water, cinder blocks, fill in the the holes with concrete, had no breaks only lunch, set up scaffolds and lift long heavy wooden planks and climb up and set the pallets of cinder blocks and water for the mix so it doesn't dry.

A Japanese manga artist named Akira Toriyama, the creator of Dragon Ball and Dr. Slump, even though both stories are fantastic but the one who stuck out the most is Dragon Ball. a young Akira saw a manga tournament who had the best manga it took him a couple tries to win and that lucky day he saw a editor from Toei Animations and told Akira great job from there he got confident and inspired that he could make something happen. later on he kept making mangas until he made one called dragon boy and one other manga and he combine both them and created dragon ball, he created Goku the main character and gave him the personality of Akira. Akria sold more than nine million copies of dragon ball from that money he made a studio call Bird Studio for his animations. Once Dragon Ball got so popular in Japan Toei Animations bought the anime from Akria and made the next Dragon Ball series called Dragon Ball Z. Dragon Ball has been around 32 years since it released in the U.S. and it still going and getting more popular. This year in January 14 the new Dragon Ball Super Broly came out in the U.S. and made one hundred million in the box office, one of the most famous anime and one of the best selling anime movies of all time.

BCBE999300EA,"Why did Winston Churchill said that "" success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm""? Because almost everyone who failed to achieve their goals, they gave up and forgot about it. The enthusiasm plays a big rule in your success more than you failure. If someone failed and lost his enthusiasm, he/she will not try again to get what they need. It is a big deal to left what you were doing just because you failed. Almost everyone failed in this life. For example, no one literally success without failure; losing your enthusiasm will cost you so much; failure is your success path.

Firstly, no one will success without failure. Without failure you will not know your problems. Either if it was small or big problems it wall affect you, so failing will help you to achieve your goal easily. Most of the billionaires lost so much at the beginning, but they worked on it. Maybe someone wondering why they will work on it if they failed and did not change the thing they were work on it, or just forgot about it? Basically because they believed in themselves, and they knew that they can do it. You have the choice either you will success or fail. If the frequency of trying was high, it is better because you will learn some experiences.

Secondly, losing you enthusiasm will cost you so much. For example: it will cost you the success on your thing that you were work on it; the money you may gain/spend from/on your thing; the happiness of your success after your struggle. Most of who are going to the gym saying ""no pain no gain"" it looks like small and simple quote, but it has a deep meaning. If they did not work hard on the gym, their bodies will not be like what did they thought. Also, ""never give up"" it is really a small quote, but with full of energy and enthusiasm. If someone told you that quote, you may do anything you can because you will not give up. Also, you will do whatever you can until you achieve your goal.

Thirdly, failure is your path for success. As I mentioned, most of billionaires failed at the beginning, but look at them now. people are giving examples on them just to be like them. In my opinion, I assume that they are working in another thing to success again and again. Literally nothing better than success after hard working. Students in school or universities are studying a lot of subjects, but they are working hard to get their dream job, car, house etc... . They knew the reward they might get after hard working. Some people are saying that once you had your first failure you must stop because you do not want more failures in your life. In my opinion, it is completely wrong. If you stop and did not try to fix it or work hard on it, you will gain nothing. What if you worked hard? You may got credit on it because you did it beautifully. People will respect you more if they notice that you are a positive person and trying hard to complete you work perfectly. When they notice that you are a negative person; hate to complete your work in a neat way; and give up so fast. They will hate to set next to you because you are negative. You must be positive, persistent, and believe in yourself to achieve your goal. You should ignore any negative messages , or anything that may affects you.

To conclude, nothing better than success after failure because you will know your mistakes and you will not do it again. You have to be patient to get what you want. It is impossible to success in one day. Always good things and success takes time because you have to set a perfect plan to achieve what you want. As I said your failure is your success path because you will learn new lesson, mistakes, patient. These three things you might see it simple, but they are very Important. They can let you success if you work hard on it, and you were perfect about it. If you notice Winston's quote, it was deep and cheerful.

What do I think about working with people or working alone, I think both have great benefits but it depends on the type of person if they are social, antisocial , or if they been through stuff. But if I was to pick one I would choose to work with a group because of how many advantages their are, if your stuck and you need help you can always ask for help from your group because theres more than one, working with your group is easier than working alone because you can do different parts at the same time meanwhile when you work alone it takes longer, it becomes more difficult if you need help and not knowing what to do. Working together gives us a bigger boost of an IQ because multiple brains are better then one and gives us a better over all grade or if the person that is working alone and is very smart he could find things easier. Working together could be fun because of the people you are working with or meeting new people in the group that you don't know and learning from them and what experience they been through.

Disadvantages are people are going to force the smarter person of the group to do all the work, if people choose the group they'll choose either the smart people of people that they get along with and mess around and not do anything, if the teacher finds out that the smart ones from the groups do all the work they'll get an f.

03CC97D3747E,"Many schools have partner ships with companies that can allow students to explore certain occupations through internships and shadowing opportunities to discover whether they are interested in pursuing that type of employment. In my opinion its a good idea to allow students to explore certain occupations through internships and to discover whether they are interested or not. By allowing them to visit and explore, they are most likely to know what they want in life and in their upcoming future, and they can get a good job that pays money in the future.

The first reason as to why it is a good idea to explore certain occupations through internships is because, students will most likely know what they really want to do in life and it will help them start a good future. I have a cousin named Generic_Name, he has three kids named Generic_Name, Generic_Name, and Generic_Name. Believe it or not Generic_Name was chosen to go to Liberty University a few years ago. He went to the College to see if anything they taught was interesting. A few months later, Generic_Name started going to Liberty for a few years and finished off with straight A's. Today he owns his own business, and he is happy as ever.

The second reason why it is good to explore certain occupations through internships is because, you are willing to get a good job that pays very well. I have another cousin named Generic_Name, He is the strongest and most bravest person I have ever met. Generic_Name is the AirForce, he joined the air force a few years ago. He loved it there although he said it was somewhat rough. He went to the AirForce because his parents didnt have enough money for him to go to college. After leaving the AirForce he chose to go to Liberty University as well, He absolutely loved it there. He graduated in 2015. He is now working for the FBI and I could not be any prouder of him then I am right now. A few weeks ago I went over to his house and he said ""Generic_Name when i was in the AirForce it was rough for me, I felt like it was useless. Now i know that god put me in that position, because he wanted something big for me. I feel like i'm on top of the world I have never felt any better then I do today. I also have so much money too, thanks to the job i have they pay really well. One of these days I want to buy a mansion."" I saw tears coming out of his eyes ,and I felt so proud, I said to myself, ""I want to feel like i'm on top of the world, I want something big for me.""

Many students may say that they don't care about college which is somewhat understandable. I was with a friend one day and I was telling her about how I want to go to college so bad, but she didnt seem to care. She looked me in the eyes and said, ""What's the point of college anyways, its just like going back to hell. My parents never went and there fine."" They also say that going to college is the worst thing ever. My friend once said, ""Why do schools even give the opportunity to students to figure out where they want to go, we don't need college and we dont need a future either. I Actually like working at Wendy's."" After my friends said those nasty things about college it just made me want to work harder in life and get better grades in school.

In conclusion, exploring certain occupations through internships is not that bad of an idea, its a brilliant idea. As i once said, I'm most likely to know what i want in the future, and I will get a good job that pays well.

5665A1317754,"I think the four-day school week is a excellent idea. The benefits of have ten hours per day is that we going to have three days weekend to enjoy, work, and pass with our family. However no everyone going to benefits with this or no everyone going to like it. We already have homework to do in the house, this is like am in school but just must comfort and free. Everyone has things to do, some people at school have part time jobs because they need it. Also is good that we learn the must the we can and every day learn something new, but the time the we past in school is a good time to learn, practices, and make new friends. There're several things the we can benefits about it.

The disadvantages of this are that the day going to be so long for us,we don't going to have time to do anything else just go to school or work come back do the necessary things an that's all, this will going to be the routine for the four day, but is only four day that's the good point of this. I really like this idea because am always think about the school was better if we only assist four day and not five, so we can have more time to do things that we are exciting about it. Life no always is about work and study sometimes we forget things that are really important. The school is part of our life, but we can find a way to come to school because we want to, not like something that you have to do.

Everything have benefits and disadvantages, but we can focuses and the benefits not always in the disadvantages. This plan has a lot of benefits if we can consider and think about it. We going to have three day do to whatever we want no school, no work, nothing to worried about it just for the family. Also is a great idea for the people who study and work they can come to school without stress and go to work the three day that we don't come to school. The Majority of students at high school can benefits with this plan. We can reconsider this idea with a view to change and make something different for the benefits of everyone.

3E7DE9C1C160,"What lesson would you chose to teach elementary school students? Would you chose math because they like numbers, or science because they like playing with science experiments. I would chose science, because we use science every day by turning on a light, to throwing a ball up in the air. Another reason many students like science is because it is the most fun, by that I mean by all the experiments we do in science. One lesson I would like to teach elementary school students is about science because it is fun, it is the most easiest subject to teach, and it is the most used in daily life.

Firstly, one lesson I would like to teach is science because it is fun to most adults and kids. First, science is fun because you get to do different types of experiments. For example, If you want to learn about kinetic and potential energy you can use science experiments that have kinetic and potential energy in them. Some experiments can have you involved in throwing a ball so you can illustrate kinetic and potential energy. Second, science is fun because everybody can enjoy it.

For example, say one student does an experiment everyone in the class can experience it because they all witnessed it. Lastly, science is the most fun to make a lesson about because it involves you talking to other people and sharing your observations. For example, If you did a egg drop experiment, you will compare your results to different types of students in your school and hopefully learn from what you did wrong or the opposite. Therefore, science is fun because you get to deal with experiments.

Secondly, one lesson I would like to teach is science because it is the most easiest to teach to many students and adults. First, science is the most easiest because it does not require you to memorize or remember something every single time. For example in other subjects unlike science you have to memorize the root words for English, or memorize the formulas for math, But here all you have to do is memorize the terminology and you should be good to go. Another reason why science is the easiest is because it is involves experiments which are not hard to understand all it requires you to do it pay attention. For example, If you pay attention to the experiment then you will know every bit of it, But in math you have to keep on practicing again and again until you get it. Third, science is the most easiest to many students because it involves drawing pictures which is the most easiest way to understand something other than memorizing. For example, say that the students don't get it by words so, what you can do is illustrate for them so they get what you are trying to say. This works best in science because because science is the subject that involves the most of drawing and experimenting. So at last, science is the best subject to teach about because it is the most easiest to understand.

Thirdly, I would like to create a lesson about science because it is most used in daily life. Firstly, it is most used in daily life because everything can relate to science. For example, it can be related to light because light can cause radiation, it can be related to the air conditioning because it involves air traveling in currents. All of these thing are related to science and there is certainly more. Secondly, Science can help you understand more of your daily life by performing a lesson. For example, say that you don't know how to use a compass, science can tell you the answer to that because it relates to the magnetic field. Last, science is the most used in daily life for fixing things and being able to understand how things work. For example, science can tell us a lot of information, some examples can be how does a circuit work, how do fix a circuit, how does a light turn on so fast, or other possible things too. In addition, science should be the lesson because it is the most used in real life.

In conclusion, one lesson I would like to teach in elementary school is science because it is the most fun and makes a lot of students smile when they do science, it is the most easiest to teach because it involves minimum talking but a lot of drawing, and lastly it is the most frequently used in real life. So therefore, I should get my science lesson ready for the elementary school students soon because they would have the most fun in this while learning. Would you teach science why or why not?

First of all,

My mom work cleaning houses she work hard to give my sister and I the things that we want, and she always have a goal to work by her self and have her own cleaning jod. Not working with a company that they make her work hard and pay her little money, when my mom came to his country [U.S.A] she start working for a women that women put her to do alot of house and pay her little money and when my mom told her that she was giving her alot of work she was angry at my mom. My mom then she start workin give another women that do the same thing they do twelve houses everyday my mom was so tired and not only that there was another women taht was working there that she hate my mom all the time they have problems. My mom don't want that anymore and now my mom have her own job she one or two hause everyday and in a week she make five or eight hundrent dollars she have work hard to get want she wants.

secondly, My parents want to buy a house to have our own house and that renting a aparment that is so small that a house and have our own space. My sister and I we were sharing the same room and we always have problems because she always have leave trush in the room she didn't pit it up I always have to do it and I was tired of that. Living in a aparment you don't have a space to plant flowers or playing around with your cousins. My parent they always were going to the bank to take up a loan but they couldn't beause they didn't have a good interentest and they continue to go to the banks and woking hard to have good interentest in the bank and fine they get it. My parent buy a hause and we have like six or seven mounth that we are living in that house.

Also, I have a friend that she study hard to have good grades and a counselor from the school call her that want to talk to her that she can calify to a university for having good grades. She went have to go for a mounth to stay in that university to know how is live of the university and compete with other students, then that same counselor take her to Generic_City for a fiel trip to go and see some people that will sing in a famouse place. She have work hard to get that things that she have get.

Accomplishing same thing that you really want a great thing beause you can have a better future and have a great life. Sometimes is hard and challenge you said I cannot to these anymore but you can do it but you have to work little hard to get there.

1E92DFF2A61B,"Dose technology effects peoples life in a good way or bad way? Many people agree that that technology effects people lifes in a bad way. Why you may ask because people want technology to do everything for them. I think the oppsit, because technology dose alot of things that helps people like x-rays,computer,cell phones.

Technoogy has a negative effect on peoples lives, People start to get lazy they don't want to do anything they just want technology to do it for them. For exaple if they don't want to cook then they will use uber eats and if they don't want to shop at stores then they shop online. People depend on technogoy to mcuh for example there cell phones, some people can't live with out there cell phones. Some people lose their job because of technology advancing so much. For example couple years ago people use to make cars now day machines do it so people that had that job loss there job because of technology.

The use of technology has a positive effect of peoples lifes, People can do stuff faster and easier. For example if you have a paper to write but you missed school ad you did your paper you can just email the paper to your teacher fast adn easy. Also people cn learn new things tey didn't know. For exaple you forget how to get some where you can just pull your phone and search it up it takes les then 30 seconds to search. Also if you don't want to make contact with others you can just text them or email them. For exaample one day you don't feel like talking you can just text them.

After all I think technology dose more positive things then negative things. Technology saves lifes every day and makes peoples lifes more easier. I don't think anyone can go with out technoogy. also I thin we should all be thankful for the technology we have now days.

CD5F70E5C1D7,"To begin with, in my opinion i think students and parents should get the choice to be involved in any type of extracurricular activties. and why im saying this is because the school does not have no right to tell you you can do this and that but if they ask you to stay to finish some school asignments or afterschool studying then i suggest you stay after if you really want to finish those assignments and get a good or decent grade on it. or if you want to do great in school or in any job and you need a lot of school for that type of job then you might want to do as much of extracurricular activites.

Second of all, if the parents dont think that you are going to do good enough in school after the extracurricular activites and if you dont have enough time for study sessions or you homework because your to tired from sports such as football, basketball, lacrosse, and soccer. then ask your teacher or whoever is controlling the activties and ask them if you can get off a little earlier because you dont have enough time for homework, studying, or FAMILY or for yourself or your friends.

but i think the school should give the students and thier faimly diffrent choices of extracurricular activties so the students can pick 2 or 3 diffrent types of them instead of not having time for thier own life. like the students can pick and choose the 2 or 3 they really want or like to do or they can pick the ones that's going to help them the most in the future of school or in thier adult life, because teachers can teach the students things from extracurricular activites that they learned or did so they wont have to ask no one else for help or hire somebody then from that you can save money and you can also get money if you help someone that doesnt know how to do that type of thing.

1D47271C213D,"The students must be self- confident in order to succeed. I agree that hard work helps to build self-esteems because students must have faith in their own abilities, they have to learn from their mistakes, and be proud of them achievements. That's why students can not be conform with insufficient work just to be admired by teachers or parents. Also, to able to be successful always needs high standards.

Even though, parents and teachers decide to praise the students by giving them gifts or other things. It can motivate the students but there is some days were people are not in a good mood and forget to praised the students. That's how students can't continue with the same motivation and loose confidence. For example, my Probability Statistics math class she used to gave us candy every single day so we never try to do our classwork, everybody failed her class.

Several students make mistakes while they are trying to accomplishing something and they give up when they don't have an easy solution. In reality that is when they are used to be treated with extreme indulgence. Of course, it doesn't matter how many mistake they make; it matters to continue believing in them self. Eventually, my friend Generic_Name came from Generic_City, she used to go to

Susbury University it was difficult for her to learn English she also failed three classes. But she did not care how many times she failed. She believe in herself and she achieved her goal now she is an ESL teacher.

How does people becomes doctors or professionals? some people don't have their parents alive or they are far away from each other so they don't have nobody to praised them. From my opinion, they should be proud of them self. All the effort, dedication, passion for the school and they don't need somebody to award them to be trust. But also, it's not easy for the students to succeed in this world unless they want to work for it. Everybody can notice when they gain something beneficial for their life and be satisfied with them great effort. From my own experience, my biology teacher it was very strict that she screamed at my face the first day of the semester but I showed her that I'm better what she thought I was. So I passed her class with an average of 80 and I also passed the SOL.

Finally, when the students are comfortable from what they already accomplished, it's when they have a great opportunity to build them self-esteems. They do not need to be pushed with emotional things to able to be confident, If they get emotional later on, they wouldn't be able to continue without being praised.

BDAE1D4B6C20,"The quote, '' hard work pays,'' means a lot when it comes to doing something and one staying idle. The world today upgrades itself each and everyday,which tells us that we should always be doing new everyday as humans.

Although some people say that been idle is the best way to go because it relaxes the body and gives it a new form of strength actually doing something always not only exposes one to new ideas and strategies but also makes the human body active and vibrant at all times. There are a lot of chances one can benefit from been productive other than been idle.

To start with, there are a lot of goodness in been productive than been an idle man. People who invest in their time to produce something meaningful are known across the globe because of their hard work and dedication. Due to how hardworking they are, they get the chance to explore new ways of doing things and new ideas that would help them in their next exploitation. For instance, since Bill Gates is hardworking man, he is known across the globe and due to this he has been exposed to other new things that would help him in whatever he is doing now. Again, when there is a football match between two different teams, and if one team is seen practicing so hard than the other, it would be considered that the team seen practicing the most would deliver more than the other team with no doubt.

Moreover, doing something always makes an individual active and lives longer than been idle. A person who is seen to be doing something productive all the time is considered to be adding more years to his or her age due to the fact that working tirelessly everyday helps keep the body in form and shape which by so doing prevents diseases that attack people. For instance when a person walks about a half and a mile to work everyday, it is very difficult to see that individual get sick because the body is always busy looking for something to do. On the other hand, idleness brings nothing but retrogression and failure because you're not able to bring forth anything productive and therefore it becomes a waste of time,energy and resources. One can make the comparison so easily between a productive person and someone been idle, a productive person can always be seen advancing from one stage to the other while an idle person will be seen at the space that he is at always.

Furthermore, when people say '' time is money,'' they are definitely talking about how one is able to use his available to produce something meaningful for himself to get money and have some other benefits as well. No one gets rich by just sitting at home, folding his hands and just expect something to happen. People may argue on this that one can make it in life when he or she inherits the possession from his family. This may be true because you may have everything to yourself but everything will be squandered if one does not work hard to top it up or add more to what he has. People choose idleness because it is more relaxing and the easiest way to go because you just sit there and wait for whatever happens to happen. Been idle can also affect a person in way or the other. In the sense that, if a person is seen to be at one place all the time, it may be considered that the person may be lazy and this may deprive him off certain opportunities that might help him in one way or the other.

Last but not least, working hard or been productive gets one a recognition or a specific type of award that goes a long way in life. There is no doubt about the fact that people who work hard are awarded the most and are the ones that are shown to the world for others to see and emulate their footsteps. For instance, Usain Bolt has been winning almost all his race in the Olympics and it sends a good message about him to the world because of how hardworking he is. Due to this someone else can decide to emulate his footsteps to become a world star like him.

Again no one chooses to be last in whatever he is doing but rather aims at the high spot. Although some people say that been idle is the best way to go because it relaxes the body and gives it a new form of strength actually doing something always not only exposes one to new ideas and strategies but also makes the human body active and vibrant at all times.

CAA2C4C4E79C,"Do you think first impressions are impossible to change? Some people say that first impressions are possible to change by getting more in detail. I agree that first impression are impossible to change because first impressions are negative and peoples thoughts don't change.

In other words, first impressions are usually negative. For example, if you see a person and he or she just has a serious face, your first impression ""that person has bad vibes''. Or a type of food that looks strange to you, you automatically start saying negative things about it.

Also, peoples thoughts never seem to really change you will always see that character or thing the same way. Why? Because nothing changes everything it remains if something does change ,it changes in negative way. As an example, people get more cruel or companies start inventing products that shouldn't be together. Your mind won't change unless that person ,place or thing changes in a positive way.

So, first impressions are almost impossible to change. First impressions can change by getting more involved and finding more information about that subject but, it is impossible to change that.

Technology allow poeple to complete many task without having contact with others. Technology have a negative effect in people life because people life is passing in front of their face without knowing, technology hurts people in many ways,and make many people to feel bad with themself.

Some people think that technology is the best creation that the human ever made because entertain and hepl people to understand many things. Others believe that technology is a easy way to make assigments because google have every kind of information. Still other argue that without technology this world would not be the same because doctors would never find the tratment for the sickness.

Technology have a negative effect in people life because they forget to live their life and the time is passing, just because they spend all their time playing video games, in the phone, and they star to getting older and because the years are passing like nothing and really fast that when they react they would see that their best years just passing, without enjoy their time with the people that they love. Many people just react only when one family member death and they start to think that life is too short, and it is why people need to apreciate and enjoy,

learn new thing, meet new places, have more experiences, and also meet new people and learn good thing from them.

Many people hurt them self in many ways for example physical and mental because physical they star to get fat and then they do not take care about their healty and if they do not take care who else would do for them, because when they star to get sick they just do not care about it, because they want to keep concentrate in their video games or telephone. metal many people just not care about their future and goals, because they are really busy thinking how to get the most advance technology device and who is usining in where they go. many people do not take care about their personal life and after few years later when the affected would be them because they did not care about their future they would have nothing and the technnology every year change, and get new devices. People need to think about what is most important something else that is really important and needed or a device that in few months would be betters phone and other devices, because for example whe a phone just come out every one want to buy and the price is more than $1000 and after few monts the price is more lower and they have another new phone, it is in what people want to spend money and time, first think and later act after they know is the best.

Technology makes people to feel bad about themselves because now people believe everything that is posted in internet, only because some people said it ect. Other make their self look better in the phone and when they look their self in the mirror they hate their self, and sometimes people look other people in internet that they post picture they want to be like them and they star to despreviate their self and start to search in google how to change or do something they can not do it or does not work they get depress, stressful and tired of their life that sime search the easy way, that many people and doing in other country that is kill their self, so technology just affect people in many ways.

Technology affect people in a negative way because people spend too much time on techonology and life is just passing. Technology is taking over people, and into they get hurt with something or someone that they love they start to see that they was doing wrong, they get dissapoinment with themselves for being so stuped, people need to use less phone and spend more time with family and enjoy every second of life because life is just one and is really short.

B2D0B9EF8748,"Technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others. People can check out books, shop, and play games without speaking to another person. Has the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had positive or negative effects on people's lives?

Technology it became a great tool for many people during these past years. Many people as students, business leaders, and others use Technology to work or study. Technology had positive and negative effects; it depends how you use it. You can talk to family and friends, when they are far from you. Also, you can purchase many things from your phone or computer, without going out of home. There is a bad thing too; if people don't know how to used Technology.

Technology help to people, when they want to communicate with someone, as family or friends. There are many applications that they can use to do video call or text. For example, I'm from Generic_City and I moved to here in Virginia when I was fifteen years old. I really missed my grandmother, but I always called her from Whatsapp. It helped me to text to her and do video chat with her; when I wanted see her. Technology helped me a lot to talk with my family, friends and buy from my favorite store of Generic_City.

Technology is amazing, when you know how to use it. People can find many things in Internet, as applications for shopping or search any information that you need for homework. Even the store is in Generic_City you can purchase clothes from there and they will sent it to you. It doesn't matter that the store is in the other side of the world you can buy anything that you want. Also when you have to search of information about something you find everything in Google. For example, I had a homework to do the last week. It was a summary of an artist and I didn't even know who was that person. I took my computer and I typed the name of the artist in the search bar. Boom there was the whole information about her. However, I saw many advertisements of pages that I didn't have like.

When people use to much Technology people becomes addictive. They use Internet to do incorrect stuffs and they have a problem. If you don't know how to use it you can get hurt or hurt to someone. There are many cases already where people are killed just for a post. Also there are people that search videos that they don't have to see. They get sick mentality. As example, Many people had been rape because they posted a picture where they look indecent. People accept request friends of people that they don't even know. They have to take care of their profile and do not give information about you to anyone. They have to be careful of what they are going to do with Technology.

In conclusion, Technology is a great tool to be communicate with people. Also is a shopping in the phone without going out of home and wasting gas of your car, but people had to be sure of what they are going to do.

7F3B3A0D56CF,"Hi elementary schools students today im going to show my lesson is that how to be a better person are in your in a bad state right now and your treating others so badly well today im going to tell you 3 ways you can be a better person but before we start i just wanna let you know that these tricks,ways. tips whenever you want to call them will not work instantly in order to work you gonna keep trying i will tell you these five words plan,rethink,try result,restart i will explain how they work and what they mean later ok now that over already lets start!

My first thing of what comes to my mind for being a better person is showing respect for others i know this is the obvious one but showing respect to others will result other people showing respect to you if your like a mean person and there that one person in your class that you dont like or get along with saying at least one nice,respectful thing could and will big difference between you and that person look i get it you dont have to be friends i know i heard about it from people and they say that you still gonna show some respect even your not friends with them and also saying nice things about that person can they feel good because you made feel good and great so that is the first that comes into my mind when it comes to be a better person and thats how step one is completed.

so for my second step is to what comes in your mind to be a better person like think about what you just say did it worked out for those who did not get it about what im talking about im talking about the result did it worked out or it did not what was coming through your mind when your saying good things so if you still dont get it this were is the four letters come in so lets start with plan.

So what comes to plan you asked well it comes to thinking in your mind in your mind your are like will this worked or will not work,also you can image the result or whats gonna happen if do that certain thing and thats pretty it for planning my next step dosent need that much explaing but i will try my best to explain alot for this next this step is called rethink by rethinking always think before you do something because you will never know it will work or not thats way always the step before do actually do the try step we will be talking about the next right here right now so for this step the same thing as rethink but this time i dont need it to explain it alot this is as know as the try step so you got your plan and you already confirm everything and now ready to try it and now you did this needs to the next step it also dosent need that much explaining the result how did it go? did it went well? did things go fresh? if did go fresh this is where the last step comes and joins the server

So for the final step dosent need that much explaining is called the try step is the final step because everyone dose not get on their first try every makes mistakes you just gonna keep trying trying trying until you finally did it and thats really it for all the four steps! B

efore we go on the last step for how to be a better person if you are feeling down or need to talk to someone about something tell someone about it or call any depression-hotline to get the help you need because you dont know what other people are going through thank you for reading this far so my final step is to just be yourself being yourself is really important because it helps you express your emotions and it helps you feel better if your that type of person is who shy and dosent wanna look people in the eyes atleast look at them in the nose it will look like your looking into their eyes and also dont try to change yourself and accept who you are because people would prefer someone who is just themselves then someone who is trying to change themselves just to fit in with other people now your thinking hows being yourself is gonna help you with coming a better person well you are just you and again people will rather go for people who are just you(themselves) than again people changing themselves just to fit in with other people trust me being yourself can you proud it dosent matter what gender,race,condition you have people will still accept you even you look different this will always one of the most important steps in becoming a better prond person!

Community service is important to the community because in the future the community change and everybody is happy. Some people doesn't wannabe help or they have other things to do. Is the same thing as school. Some students is in Community service.

First reason, that Community service is important because the mayor of the city will be proud. Some people say ''What a mess is here!''. The community service is come for help. When you left trash then later it will smell bad. Some people hated when this happened. Please don't leave thrash on the floor put it in the trash can.

Second reason is that when there's a event the people who work there have to clean up before the event starts. Some people think that takes too much time away but no. They just want to help people and the community. In school is the same thing friends doesn't want to help and some to.

In my opinion working in group should be more benefits.

Teacher should let student work in group.

Teacher should be allow students to work in group. There are three reason why should they let student work in group:

Working in group think more stronger and faster. Each of every students can catch a mistake. It would benefits to get more information about what topic they will do it.

Firstly, you can look more than one idea. Secondly, each students can make one question about what they are doing. Thirdly, if you work in group you can be more comfortable with your work.

Your working should have the best idea and should not be any mistake because before to give the work to the teacher every students should look at it.

It would be more interesting to meet another students and know what they can do it, and if you can help in something that they don't it. Also, in some schooler teacher let student to work in group because some students don't feel comfortable to do the work by themselves. Some activities should be necessary to do in group.

For example, when they are doing a project. However, most of the classses have workshit to do in group.

For example, make experiment in a lab, present in front of the class.

Some students say that work in group is more funny than being alone.

Sometimes, teacher don't like to put student in group becasue they observe that when student are in group they just talk about anothers thnig not about what they tell you , but not all the students like that.

In conclusion,

for these reasons is more benefits to work and group than work alone.

EDA0DCA3FC41,"I don't think that school districts should allow students to graduate early. I believe that this is a bad idea because students have to take more classes than what you usually take, students would have to stay after school or maybe even take summer school, so they can get enough credits to graduate early, and students would be very stressed having to learn all this material for each of their classes, since they won't be taking any electives. For these reasons, I don't think school districts should allow students to graduate early.

Students who are graduating early, will have to take extra classes during the school year, so that they can earn the credits for their classes. In many schools, you have to have at least four credits in one subject, so that means the student will most likely have to take two classes of one subject to earn the credits for that one specific subject. Some students graduating early, might have a difficult time being all caught up in each of their classes, which can lead to them having to stay after school to take tutoring classes in case they don't understand the material being taught.

Most students, will either have to take school during the summer or they stay after school to take extra classes. Students who stay after or do summer school do this, so that they can earn all the credits they need to graduate early. Students who choose to do summer school don't have to take that many classes when they go back to school, since they already took some classes during the summer. Students who choose to stay after school to take extra classes, will have to stay in school longer, so they can learn all the material for the subjects that they are taking after school.

Students will be stressed and under pressure when it comes to learning and studying for each of their classes. They will be stressed because they're going to have to study for a lot of their classes, when they take tests and sometimes they can have tests in multiple classes on the same day, which means they are going to have to study for multiple classes. Same thing applies with homework, they will feel under pressure to get all their work done. They wouldn't be taking any electives, so that means all their classes will be hard, since elective classes are usually easy.

This is why I think that graduating early is a bad idea, because students will be very tired and stressed trying to catch up on school work. If you do four years of High School instead of three years, everything will go a lot slower than three years and also you will be less stressed, when it comes to catching up on school because you will have less classes to worry about. This is why it's better to do four years of High School.

However, technology it is not important because distract many people from real world and cause a big effect in teenager young.

Technology can distract many people from the real world. For example, my brother he is a good student, he have great grade, he had a excellent person he always complete his homework, but when he being use your phone, video games, computer, he lost interest in his High School today he always used his phone,

when he have homework he just use the computer for find information, but before he read books, or in his book notes for find a better information, but now he prefer use the computer or his cell phone that looking in books, he almost always leave with his friends to have a time to fun or do others thinks like when they having homework they go to the library and looking for a books to find information about their homework, in his High School he can learn much but he never put attention because he always pass playing video games, today he not have friends, he not talk with nobody because he prefer technology that get out with his friends .

today young people not worry about their own education or their own learning it is more important to use technology, when young have homework they prefer use technology like computer or in their cell phone, the correct will be go to the library and try to find a books to bring information.

Technology will be limitation in all society of this way we are helping to private of many things like accidents and young people can learn more.

5A6AE4CDEEF1,"The school bus doors close with a hiss behind you as you walk down your driveway. You enter your house and sigh with boredom. Once again, the rest of your family is out participating in activities, and you are left alone at home with nothing to do. This situation has occurred to many people that don't participate in any extracurricular activities. I believe that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students will be able to meet new people, find a new passion, and it gives them something to do.

If you are looking to meet new people, joining an extra curricular activity is a great way to do it. It is easier to make friends with people whom you share common interests with. So, it will be less difficult for you to talk to someone who has joined the same club as you because all of the people in that club at least share the common interest of the subject of the club. Participating in the same activity and being in the same room encourages you to talk to people. When I am at swim practice, I am encouraged to talk to the people in my lane because we are swimming together for one and a half hours, so why not get to know them? Because of this, I have made new friends outside of school, and I regularly spend time with my new friends outside of swim practice as well. Meeting new people is only one benefit of extracurricular activities, however, there are many more.

It is hard to discover hidden passions if you don't try new and different activities. Through these new activities, you could discover that you have a strong interest in robotics that you were not aware of before. If you find an activity that you are passionate about, your life will be much more exciting and enriching. It can also help you figure out what type of career you want to pursue when you grow up. Naturally, people will want to pursue careers that are related to subjects they are interested in. So, it will be much easier for you to decide because you have discovered your passions and talents at an earlier age. My father signed me up for theatre one year, and when he first told me, I was apprehensive. I am naturally a shy person, so I didn't think that I would enjoy being on stage in front of a large crowd of people. But, I ended up really enjoying the whole experience and participated in that theatre camp for three more years. Also, when I first started taking piano lessons, I thought that it would be a huge waste of time. But, I found that I was quite talented at playing the piano, and I enjoyed creating music that my family and friends would loved listening to. Extracurricular activities help you uncover new passions, and they also provide you with something to do.

Participating in an extracurricular activity is a productive way to use your time. Many students come home and waste time on the internet or social media because they have nothing better to do. There is nothing worse than coming home and finding out that your child spent four hours watching a cartoon on TV. An activity would give them something to think about or allows them to spend their time somewhere productive. When I have nothing to do at home, I play the piano because it is a great way for me to use excess time and I enjoy doing it. On the days that I am not at swim practice, I would feel like I have too much time on my hands. But, I have other extracurricular activities scheduled for those days. like meeting with my math team or piano lessons, which prevent me from experiencing painful boredom. These are only a few reasons why students should participate in extracurricular activities, and it can be seen that there are significant benefits.

In conclusion, students should participate in extracurricular activities because they give you something productive to do, they help you find new passions, and allow you to meet new people. Every student should choose one extracurricular activity to participate in because of the plentiful benefits these activities provide. Suddenly, you realize that today was the first day of track practice, and you frantically call you friend, asking them if they can come pick you up and bring you back to school.

C84D7D9C5F1F,"The reason why people do so is because they want to see if they have been in the same place as the person asking for advice. In my opinion getting different options helps them even more because that way his or her different friends response may help them and he or she gathers up the importation that is given and they choose whether it's good advice or not. When i need advice i go to three friends and they each give me a different response (advice) and its hard to choose which you want to take, but once you put all three responses together then it gets easier for you and you make a good choice by it.

Having multiple responses the better because the more you know the better, but sometimes the best advice you can ever find is from a family member that older then you or at least 18 and up because what advice you're looking for maybe they know more and can tell u what their advice is other than your peers. Another reason why you should ask your parents is because they can have more experiences then you and your peers and knowing from them is better then your peers because your parents don't like lying to you very often, so they give you the truth on what they think. Other then your peers because you can be friends with someone who doesn't like you and can tell you a whole other different story and make you do a mistake you didn't want to do.

It's good getting advice from may different people because its like a certain way of helping you on what your problem is. You can get so many different responses by what certain topic you choose, either its getting into a relationship, a certain subject you have trouble on or its how you want to change into being better, etc. That's why its better having different responses because you have so many to choose from and you dont have to stress out on thinking of some on your own when you have plenty ideas from different people. Some advises can not be strong on how you want it to be but it can help you in like, thats why its good having friendships with so many different people because you have more answers to your question or better advice from some of them.

EEF3247D69D0,"Some schools propose the idea of distance knowledge as an option for students to take online classes or having meetings from home. I honestly don't agree because students can have the opportunity to learn more when they are at school and not at home, socialize better and understand what is outside of the world. Here is why I don't agree by this reasons.

My first reason of why, I dont agree that students should take classes at home is because students can have the opportunity to learn more when they are at school. My mom always taught me that is better having a good education when you are in the environment, because you see people around you that are having the motivation to learn everyday. When my mom was in high school, her education was easy because she got the support by her teachers in any classes that she couldn't understand. Many of her friends were working hard to get good grades, she never did homework at home; it was difficult for her to study in an environment where people usually can get lazy in their own space to have any break. ""You can't compare a temple with a laboratory science, both are too opposites and what happens with school is the place where you have to focus for what you are learning while our home is the space where we can take any break after our hard work"". My mom

My second reason of why, I don't agree that students should take classes at home is because students can socialize better when they are at school. As my own experience, we have the opportunity to meet other students while we our in classes. For example: ""I am very shy to ask a teacher any question, so I go and I ask to another student who does understand what the teacher is explaining"". Meeting new people in school is a good experience because you can make connections with any other students and teachers also; thanks to that communication, we can have that trust of our self to be prepared of anything. Therefore school can be our first path of having a good or professional communication with any person, for example, applying for a job.

Another reason of why, I don't agree that students should take classes at home is because students will understand what is outside of the world. As I said before, socialize can give us that trust of our self to be prepared of anything. The position of school of giving good education to students every year is the real path to prepare us for what is outside. One of my teachers, Mr. Generic_Name, shared to all of his class of how hard workers we have to be in life, he never gave up on his goals. At the beginning, it was hard for him after he graduated from high school to college because everything was different for him; meeting new people with a new environment wasn't easy, but he always tries his best of himself by using the same method that school gave him, by been open mind and having good communications with others. Mr. Generic_Name also believes that life is always a challenge for us and is better to face that instead of been afraid. ""I you think that school is the worst place where you can't handle it and you prefer to lock yourself at home, then you won't like what is outside"".

Some students may argue that is a better option to take classes at home because they don't feel comfortable with other students, if a student have an accident;the student can finish any work at home, or school is not the best improvement for them.

the reason of why some students don't get comfortable in school is because they might have the afraid for other students who want to feel superior from others and bullying is an obstacle for the them and not have the opportunity to defend themselves, or the other reason might be that they don't like to socialize. I personally believe, that students can find a better way to solve their problem by communicating with their own parents or with the teacher that they can trust, figuring out a way to make the student feel comfortable. If the student doesn't like to socialize and prefers to stay at home, the student needs to understand that even outside is not a paradise, people in school who can make him feel that the student is not alone and sometimes is better to talk.

Finally, if some schools offers the opportunity to study at home can be a good benefit for the student. Even tho is not a bad option studying at home, the best option to understand everything in classes is when you are in a building with other people with the same level as you are of learning and you can share any of your experience with others. One of this circumstance that can happen in life for example: If a student has an accident were he/she can't return to school for a while, is understandable that the student can do their work at home, but after they return as healthy they were is better for them to go to school because the student can still have the support from their teachers.",Male,12,Hispanic/Latino,831,907,891,27,7,127.2857143,62.56364051,29.54796031,268,907,Independent,Economically disadvantaged,Distance learning,3.5,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,"some schools propose the idea of distance knowledge as an option for students to take online classes or having meetings from home. i honestly don't agree because students can have the opportunity to learn more when they are at school and not at home, socialize better and understand what is outside of the world. here is why i don't agree by this reasons. my first reason of why, i dont agree that students should take classes at home is because students can have the opportunity to learn more when they are at school. my mom always taught me that is better having a good education when you are in the environment, because you see people around you that are having the motivation to learn everyday. when my mom was in high school, her education was easy because she got the support by her teachers in any classes that she couldn't understand. many of her friends were working hard to get good grades, she never did homework at home it was difficult for her to study in an environment where people usually can get lazy in their own space to have any break. ""you can't compare a temple with a laboratory science, both are too opposites and what happens with school is the place where you have to focus for what you are learning while our home is the space where we can take any break after our hard work"". my mom my second reason of why, i don't agree that students should take classes at home is because students can socialize better when they are at school. as my own experience, we have the opportunity to meet other students while we our in classes. for example ""i am very shy to ask a teacher any question, so i go and i ask to another student who does understand what the teacher is explaining"". meeting new people in school is a good experience because you can make connections with any other students and teachers also thanks to that communication, we can have that trust of our self to be prepared of anything. therefore school can be our first path of having a good or professional communication with any person, for example, applying for a job. another reason of why, i don't agree that students should take classes at home is because students will understand what is outside of the world. as i said before, socialize can give us that trust of our self to be prepared of anything. the position of school of giving good education to students every year is the real path to prepare us for what is outside. one of my teachers, mr. genericname, shared to all of his class of how hard workers we have to be in life, he never gave up on his goals. at the beginning, it was hard for him after he graduated from high school to college because everything was different for him meeting new people with a new environment wasn't easy, but he always tries his best of himself by using the same method that school gave him, by been open mind and having good communications with others. mr. genericname also believes that life is always a challenge for us and is better to face that instead of been afraid.

FAA9FC1B315B,"In my personal opinion when some schools offer distance learning as an option for student to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing I mostly disagree. Its not because I am attending a public high school. There are reasons why I mostly disagree about this situation.

One of the reasons why I disagree is because this might hurt the students communication skills.

when you have classes online you are not at the school you are home taking this class so you basically don't associate with anyone except your teacher now since i have never took a online class i wouldn't be able to tell if its better to not know no one or to associate with anyone but personally I just dont't thing it's good for students to attend online school if you are someone that like to work with people and not just your teacher. Other students also might be able to understand some stuff that you don't understand and that they should be able to help you. They won't be able to help you if you not there with them.

The second reason why I disagree and I really don't think that online schools is not beneficial is that it hurts your participation skills too. Here in school we do so much activities connected to things we are learning and it helps very much because if you do activities connected to the things we are learning it gets stuck in your mind. Its also better to ask questions and to understand better. There might be some stuff that you didn't understand face to face with your teacher its better to ask them like that and understand like that instead of emailing them or contacting them through different thing.

Also the teacher might not respond as soon as possible and that might be a problem and affect your grade and thats why its better to talk to your teacher face to face and deal with understanding face to face that's my second opinion.

My last and final reason is that you might get lazy and miss classes since you take it at your home . That might affect your grade too which is very risky if you're not a productive and committed person to your education online class is not for you. For example me personally it will not be good for me because I am a very lazy person i am pretty sure I

will miss classes either by sleeping in or some other unexeptalbe reasons . But also there are people that are very organized and careful people out here that can risk this for those kind of people online classes are good and they can take it because thy are committed to Finnish there education in a very careful way.

Those are my good reason why i don't agree with online classes it's a good thing that schools offer distance learning as an option for students if you have a good reason why you don't actually go to the school but personally i dont agree with this situation.

191F78EF6D73,"I agree that failure plays in the success. In order to success something, you need to try your best. Theres always a time you fail at things in the beginning. When you try hard to be successful in something that matters to you, you try hard and wont give up on yourself.

Failing helps you learn a lesson and make you want to try harder and success. In High School, if you fail an SOL, they have you redo it till you success and get a good high score on it. An SOL is a big example of being successful and trying. In High School, if you fail something, theres always one more chance of retaking and trying to pass once more time. Not trying hard to success is something different when you just give up and dont try to be successful. Thats when you just start to fail. Failing brings you down a big level and youd regret it. Being successful is better than having to retry and retry something that youve tried multiple times. You eventually give up on the thing that youve tried being successful on. If you keep trying on something that your stuck on, dont be the person to give up. Some people thinks it gets tiring. It isnt good to give up. Success is a great accomplishment to do.

Failing is a trick to your brain.

Failing makes you want to try harder and harder and makes your brain work harder to think as well. The brain is your big helper. Your brain makes you want to think more and try to successes on what position you had failed on. You should mainly think about your grades if failing. As a student, i think failing is horrible and i think trying your best to succeed is the best thing you can do. So that way you succeed on what you need to pass.

This is why i agree with Minister Winston Churchill, if you fail then try to success dont give up and keep up on trying hard to success. Success is a hard thing when somethings challenging, but can do it, just dont give up.

AAFE35314AEA,"some student to get they self-steem, believe that praising is the best way for they get the best work they ever seen but i desagree with that, because praising is not the only way you have to get the best work or the best option.

first the student must be know that he have to learn by they self how to be more confident in they life, because praising is not the only way that is gonna help then to be grates in they life they must be think how they can do they own work not just for praising to make they self-steem.

second they have to look inside of they life and think how they gonna to the best work the best studen without praising.

theer must student believe is the only way to get god happy and make good works, but that is not true, the true is that and i believe in the way you was dicipline when you was a kid in you make you own self is in how you want to make it .

another example i will like to put is that in what wey you pray, you no must praised just for the simple way you have a huge work for the school the way you must be praising is in the wey that your families is in there that is when you must be praising for your family and that can help you for your future, no for a work if you want to make a really good work you must be work hard the whole night or the whole day to make that better and the best of the class.

the most important thing of this not in how you make your decition or your self- confident is the way you train to make your self praising don't came from achievement they come for are self in what way we must want to make it,

I think that the more important thing in your life is not if you prasing ir not for any work or any kind of that i think if you gona pray is when you want to talk to god and tell him that you really need help in any ocaccion that is dificult for us.

on my conclucion i believe the dicipline get you in a way that is gonna help you in your life and in your future because with dicipline you learn how to be more confident , how to have more self-steem, and how to do the best work, is not only because few student believe that praising is gonna make your self-steem, you make you own way in how you want to make it, your self is not supposted to be the way that another person want to make you i think you must be make you own self importan for you, You can make your self confident,steem, and powerful, with dicipline and keep doing it in the best way you can,

i think the true self-steem came for how hard you work in your self is not came from what you think, i think the must important thing is in how you think you can make you own self, and some student said that, the self-steem just came from achivement i think is true in some way's, i thing they come from are inside of what we want to be in our life, and the another thing is that is true that we have to work in are self but not in a bad way, so that is what i think and believe about praising.

10A367BB87EB,"Based on Emerson's statement, I firmly agree that if you never try to do something beyond what you already know, you will never do something and know if you could have done it or of you were good at it. Based on my experience, for what I've live and for what I know, I strongly believe and agree with this statement. My brother for example wanted to be an engineer, with hard work and effort he made it. In the other hand we have Hitler, he went from being a simple art student to one of the most exponent dictators of Germany.

For example, my brother wanted to be an engineer since he was little, at the time he reach High school, he was sure what career he wanted for his future. He started taking courses that would help him get credits for college and getting involve with sports that would help him get scholarships. Also, he took classes that would help him improve his skills and understanding of his future career. Now with hard work and effort, he graduated as an engineer from Generic_school and he's happily working with his dream job. This shows that with hard work you can accomplish any goal and letting yourself grow.

Another example was Hitler, he went from being a simple art student to one of the most exponent dictators of Germany. At a young age Hitler had a dream, he wanted to study arts, he started working on it, but when he apply to college he wasn't accepted. That was the moment when Hitler decided to do something different, and experience something new that could change his life. With hard work and patience he did it. Even though he fail the first time, he didn't give up, therefore, he became a dictator.

Some people say that you should do what life gives you at the moment because even if you work hard, sometimes you don't reach what you were hoping for and the work is not even worth it, however, you should always try to do something to grow because if you don't, that's when life gets too bored, you don't have to be in the same spot your entire life. You need to let yourself expand and fly to grow and experience something beyond what you already know, something that will make proud at the end of the day.

In conclusion I agree with Emerson's statement that if you never try yo do something beyond what you already know, you will never grow and never have experience something out of your comfort zone. You'll never know if what you could have done was worth your time, which is why you should always try to something beyond what you have already master and challenge yourself to do bigger things that you never knew you could.

9528CA8FFC22,"Farmer British prime minister Winston Churchill once said that ''Success consists of going form failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. I agree with Churchill's Statement because some time in life u fail but never gave up in life. keep fighting and you will get to the place you want to get. Work hard if u fail and fail never say i'm done trying the same thing over and over. Because one day u will not know what will happen if u keep trying.

Firstly,Some people think that success consists of going from failure to failure without loss some time people feel safe without loss in their life. For explane you trying to became a prime minster in the future and people telling you. Can't became a prime minister but all you get to do is work heard in life true in yourself you can do anything you put you mind to in life.

Secondly. some people think that success consists of going from failure to failure with a loss. Some people think that failure to failure is good because some time people like to try one think over and over on tell they do good at it so that what some people think in life to gave when the chances to do the same thing over and over even if they could't do it they just when to keep trying.

Sometime people think that success consists of going from failure to failure without loss. Because they dont like to keep trying one thing over and over so they feel safe without loss in their life. But other think that success consists of going from failure to failure with a loss. Because people like to try the same thing over and over on tell they do good at it.

People should always seek guidance from experts and authorities whenever they are making any big decisions. It will be more easier for them to choose options when they seek guidance from someone who already knows about it. People often tend to make wrong decisions when they make decisions by themselves. A lot of celebrities have their personal guidance which is their manager. Manager makes a thoughtful decisions for celebrities to keep them on track of their career.

41EAC230D430,"People who have a lot of experience in life have started off the same way as everyone one else, from the bottom. Their first ever job was something that they probably had never done before, this makes it so that they had to learn and adapt to something they were unfamiliar with. Hiring these people, people who had little to no experience to what they are now are the one who went on in life by learning and adapting. Hiring new people can also benefit employers in a positive way, by having someone with no experience can help grow that person professionally. Also finding someone with a lot of knowledge at something may be difficult for they all have jobs that require experience. This in the end can make it hard for employers to find someone just right for the position they need

Hiring someone who doesn't have experience in the job position you are looking for can be a good thing, first, it can help the employee discover skills for themselves and outside of the job, second, it can or will make the employee much better and more reliable for the position. New employees need a mentor or someone who can show them the correct ways to do the job and who ever the mentor is, it can help them grow their leadership skills dramatically. Having skill diversity among the group can also be very beneficial it can result in the new employees finding new ways to manage things on the job and may even find ways to replace the old rules for better ones. Some people are fast learners so he/she will adapt to the new work environment very easily. Building up experience is a key part in life and and some point there will be a time to get a job and seeing that everyone has started from the bottom, and hiring someone new can really benefit the company and the employer

Do i think that employers should hire someone that doesn't have any experience at something; yes, once hiring he/she the employee will do whatever it takes to keep that job and find new ways to grow while on the job. it is also a good way to expand company diversity and skills.

In the end, anyone who is looking for a job should be given an opportunity to learn and acquire skills to become better and stronger experience wise. Employers should mostly take notice on how ready and determined he/she is for the job rather than hoe much experience they have. At some point even the employer was given a chance so whoever the person may be should also be given a chance at this opportunity. I hope you take this letter into consideration and offer positions to someone who is eager to learn and be part of your group.

DA86BC9B9FB6,"I think is a good choice for people to take classes online or at home because they can learn more and concentrate better and put more attention and nobody can distract them. I think if people do it online or at home they are not going to make friends. Sometimes is good to make friends because they can help you or be with you in someway is good to go school then taking at home or online. Also if they do it online or at home they are going to be more prepared and ready for wet ever situation because they was putting attention in their lessons. But being in a group in school is more interesting because you can meet new people and don't be alone doing the work but everything have their good choices for do it and people can decide how they want to do it or how much they want lo learn.

some people prefer to take classes from home or online. because they can be more concentrate without nobody distracting them. I think it will be a good choice for them to do it online. For example if they are doing work in a group they are talking and don't concentrated but if they are with nobody they can work better and do their work. This can be the reason for more people take that classes because they work better with out no one else. The people who studies online or at home are more intelligent, and learn more because they are concentrate in what they are doing. In sometimes in the schools they are not concentrate because they are playing or talking with their friends and that can distract people. If they make a competition an student who studied on line or at home with one student is a regular school I think the student is not on the school can win because sometimes that students are more prepared then the regular school. Also sometime the students who go to a regular school they just go for play with their friends is good to have some friends but they are not concentrate o they are sleeping when the teacher is explaining and then when they do the exam or quiz they fail. But if one student is studding online or at home they are listening for when they have to take the exams they can pass and are more responsible with that.

When the school is over at the end of the year some people learn a lot but some people no because they were just playing and don't putting attention or sleeping in class. But the people who studies online or at home they are ready know a lot because they were concentrated and no one was distracting them and that if how they work someones want to learn and pass and someones no each one can take their own decision. I think studies online is more better, more productive at the and of the year. Taking classes at home can benefit at the students in many ways and they know more at the end of the school.

AF3B7259A43A,"The question I have been asked the most is "" What do you want to be when you grow up."" Lots of people ask me that question because I am a junior, but I am still deciding on what I want to be. Some people may think choosing a career at a young age is a great idea, but in reality it really is not a good idea. Committing to a career at a young age is not the best idea because they are to focus on their future that they don't see what is going on in their life's, also it is bad for your health, and kids might change their minds.

I see too many children and teenagers focusing on their future way too much that they don't have time to see life. Its better to enjoy life now at a young age then later at a much older age. Kids, children, and young students should be outside playing with dolls or toys not worrying about their careers. In addition, some people don't have time to be with their own families because they're choosing their careers.

Scientists say "" That worrying about careers and the future is really bad for your health."" You are thinking to much about your future that you get headaches when you think. Often in times, you have to many applications to do or to much homework that you don't get enough sleep. For example, I am a junior this year, sometimes I stare at a computer to much because of college applications;

when I am done my eyes start to hurt really bad.

When i was a little girl I would always say "" I want to be a secretary"" ,but now I want to be an accountant. We as people will not always like the same things we use to like when we were little.

As you have read, in this passage, focusing on our careers at a young age is not the most important thing in our lives at that moment.

7553FB3C21DF,"BENEFITS OF A FOUR-DAY SCHOOL WEEK

Getting enough sleep is one of the best thing one could ever have! This is equivalent to having an extra day off at work or school. Therefore, schools should adopt the habit of a four-day school week by extending the school day two hours. The benefits of changing to a four-day school week, conserves energy and resources, improves academic performances and provides enough time to complete school assignments.

The amount of energy and resources used at school for a whole week is more than what we use at home. An example of such is electricity and water. The more we use, the more the school pays for it. That one extra day off reduces expenses in respect of food services,transportation and utilities.

Not only does the school conserves energy and resources, but also offers teachers and students an additional day for rest every week. As a result of that, there is less stress over school works. Students feel less pressured because they have enough rest at home before coming to school. This is an important factor that helps improve the academic performances of students.

Notwithstanding the fact that, the school conserves energy and resources, and provides enough rest, students will also have enough time to complete their assignments. Most students complain they do not get time at home, to finish up with the homework given to them by their teachers. When this continuously happens, it could drop down their grades. Having an additional day, making it three-day weekend instead of two, will give them more time to prepare for tests and study at their own pace.

Switching to a four-day school week will help change a lot. It would have a positive effect on the school, students and as well as the parents.

EEEF81C2E133,"I am writing this prompt to inform you about the position for hiring. I would be very delighted if I could be hired by you. I do not have experience at all but, I can show you that I am a good candidate for this job and I could handle the job very well. Here are some few reason why I would be a good candidate for the job.

One reason on why you should hire me is that even though I don't have experience I tend to learn really fast and do multiple things at a time. Usually I memorize them very easily. It has a greater impact on me because I learn fast and customers are more happy with the service. Also, I could do many things at a time which is good for the job and good for the customers.

For example, in some restaurants it takes long for someone to do your order or even get to your table to get your order. It is better if you have someone that is fast and shows that the customers are there number one priority. It is good that the customers feel welcomed and feel important when the workers are giving them attention.

Another reason is that I have an amazing, outstanding attitude with people. I am a very joyful person and what I feel like is right, is giving joyfulness to customers who need it. For example, I have friends that sometimes have had a rough day and I tend to help them and make them happier and change their perspective to a better one. I think it is good that if a restaurant has someone happy and joyful the customers would want to come in because its a very joyful place. My goal is always to see poeple smiling and keept encouraging them to always be happy.

The restaurant can always make more money when customers feel like its there home.

Lastly, I like meeting new people at jobs and working as a group. What I love to do is bringing everyone together and making new friendships.

I've seen that when working as a groups it is better because you get things done faster. You also make greter connections with your coworkers. For example, If someone needs something for a customer and your busy doing something else its better to ask a coworker to help you out. I like bringing bonds together and working with them.

These are some of the reason I would love to get the job. I want to learn something new thats not from my perspective. I love trying new things and getting to know the different types of jobs around the community. I also learn very fast and I love being commited to anything and working as a group.

AB282AA96403,"Students Should Be Able To Identify A Career At A young Age.

First,Students should have a career at time they enter high school because they could complete their high school classes and finish their career. Second, Students would have the apportunity to think what their dream job would be. Students would be studying and finishing their career at the same time. In that way they would star working right after completing high school. If a student doesn't like the career they have choosen, they could star over and study what they might like. Reasons why this is a big deal, is because almost 99% of students wants to finish high school as fast as they can, because they want to attemt college, and finish college in a few years. Student want to become independent. Students from their parents, but they dont have a job because their too young.

It would help students to get more free time to do any school work that they could not finish during school or any other thing they would like to do. It would help many students that work during the weekends; by given students a free day off a five-day school week, can help them to finish any school work that they could not finish during the school week.

To begin, students like me that would like to learn different things out of school, for example: boxing, drawing, singing or just to get better in yours skills can get a good benefit of this four-day school week model. To be honest, it could help me a lot too. I always like to try or learn new things and I know many other students like me that would like to learn new things out of school. Like me for example, I like boxing, but I cannot practice it at school. By given us a four-day school week; I would have some time to practicing in my skills and get better at anything that I wish do get better and not just me, I have friends that like to draw, but they do not practice it because they dont have time, because they work which means they only got time to get their homework done.

For intense, students that works during the weekends by given them an extra day off to do what they cannot do in the weeks days would help them.

In fact, students that work during week days can help them a lot too. Following this model in school, teachers or any school worker can be beneficial for them too, because they can get more time to expend with their families or they can use this time to revise students work.

Although, following this model can cause some issues. Some students can get bored. Expending the school day two hours can cause some students to increase their stress or anxiety; students that don't like school can try to skip some hours, which means the security have to improve their methods to stop students from skipping classes.

In my school we join sports and some after school classes and if we join some sports or some activities after school we have credits and it add up to your grades and people doesn't want to participate because they're lazy and sometimes they make up stories that the have headache, sick, stomach ache, and just skipping after school classes. And sometimes they fail some classes and teachers wants to convince them to join and stay after class and make their grades up.

I have a friend that is a bit of a trouble in school his name is Generic_Name he ask me if I could help him do his work and I said to him that "" You can join activity classes at social studies, or stay after school, and it makes your grades high and you can learn something "" And he didn't followed me, and thats why he still have one F on Social Studies.

If I was the principal I would make every students join sports and make them stay after school for those school activities, and if they have like an F in one class or a missing assignment I would call their parents and ask the parents if their child can stay after class and make their bad grades or missing assignment gone and make their grades higher and get extra credits for participating for after school activities.

And if I was the student I can convince them by letting students know if they have problems on their work or missing assignments I would let them convince to join the after school activities or stay after to do some retakes on their test or quizzes and figure out what is wrong with their grades and fix them and make their grades high. And those who doesn't want to join the after school activities will remain have an F for the 2nd quarter.

One reason to stay busy doing something is that will help you to develop new things, and focus doing things that you like to do, and see your potential and be able to do anything you have in mind.

Another reason is that doing something will help you to open your brain, and think positive, also have big ideas that will be very helpful for your life, if we want to be a successful person, never have to be idle. For example if you want to be a professional soccer player you have to train and work very hard everyday on it to get it, practice skills, develop your abilities. If you just watch videos on YouTube and don't do anything, that will not help you to get it, you have to put on practice to get it.

Another example is if you will have a test and you want to get an A, you have to studies your notes and not be lazy, if you just go to take the test without know anything, you will fail the test, you have to be a positive person, feel comfortable, and believe in yourself.

Some people will say it's your life do what you want, make your own decisions but it is not that easy. I feel like sometime it's better to get guidance from other people, like my parents or older siblings because they are older and have been through some of the thing I have gone through. Sometimes things get hard in life and you are going to need help, we all as people need someone in life to help guide us through thing that may be bad. If you don't know what you want to be in life then you can think about things you like or get help from someone that you know that had that career. There is always going to be someone to go to for help even though people will say it's better to work by your self because you will not make any mistakes but we all make mistakes.

E73CF852AC12,"Positive attitude is the key to be successful in life. Most of the time older people or somebody you don't really know they will tell you to give all your effort and think smart. By having a positive attitude people feel more happy and comfortable. For example,when they have a positive attitude people stars to give you some advises from the experiences they have been through. In life to have a positive attitude we have to know how to deal with our problems even tho sometimes we might think we can not do it but, there is always a solution and after all that has happened we learn how to have a smart thinking and not giving up.

Having a positive attitude makes people have a good communication with others. When having a conversation with another person you can learn more about anything. Sometimes the people who has good skills or positive attitude in their jobs or any other occupations they have the opportunity to earn a higher position in their job. For example,all managers have that position because they have showed that they can have a good attitude with themselves and other people. This gives them the chance to be a successful person in life and help to become as them.

Education is also a big influence and how a person can have a good attitude and good values. Life teaches people how to control their emotions and help those who need it. In life to become successful people needs to have a goal and a plan how they are going to accomplish that. I know sometimes we have many problems and we think it not possible to have a good attitude but, there is a way how to deal with bad attitude and always have in mind the goal we want to accomplish one day.

There is always people who is going to say negative things to others instead of give them advises. Also many people think they can not do it after they try the first time and did not happened how they expected. People has to keep in mind that not always everything will be easy to get and there will be obstacles in life that will make you feel that you can not get what you want. By thinking and having a positive attitude people can make it become true just don not give until you have reached your goal.

In conclusion,in my opinion having a positive attitude can make people become successful in life. Be some educated persons and listen to what others say to them. Many older people or family might not want to see you fail and that is the reason for those who keep a positive attitude so they will be proud of those who protrude in life.

This is one of a better way which a person should let others people influence them.

In my opinion this does not always work as a good infuence because you can let other people influence you by their own good experiences, for example;

if a person tell you when i was 19 years old, i was about to graduated from high school and i did not have no idea what i was going to do after my graduation, because i was not interest in any career, but then i decided to be a doctor even thought i didn't like at all and yes, i tried it. Now i am a doctor, i love what i do, i like my proffession, and you should do the same as me; choose a career i'm pretty sure you will like it and get used to it, but by the way you probably you wouldn't as the person said and you probably may regret to have done what they said.

Some people believe it is a good idea for students to finish high school in three years.

Most of the students do not get enough mature education from the high school. Most of the students who finish high school in three years, basically, they have the shaky education skills.

If students want to finish high school early, then they do not have opportunity to learn some extra courses beside their necessary courses such as some extra AP classes, and some electives. Also, they are not able join school's extracariculam activities like some important clubs. such as National English Honor Socity, National Science Honor society, etc for lack their of the time. Some of these extra important activities and classes may give them much knowledge to do better in collage that they couldn't get out early from the high school. That's why students do not get enough mature from the high school education.

Students lost the normal student life. They have to rush to finish high school early, so they have to finish lot of things in a short time. They have to take all normal classes, and also the class in the evening. They have to take the class in summer, so they couldn't enjoy the summer with family and friends. Also, some of the students not able to take the enjoyable elective courses like PE, music, and art for their rush to finish high school early. Sometimes, they get frustrated on their life. Basically, they couldn't enjoy the beautiful student life like other normal high school students. That's why student's lost their normal student life.

Most of the students' future affected by this decision. Sometimes, they maxed out everything to rush for get out early from the high school. Students have lot of test in a same time, but they do not have enough time to prepare well for all the tests. For that, most of the students do not get good grades and most of them do not get the main function of the subject. As a result to finish high school early and do not understand the main concept of high school's subjects, so they need much more time to understand the higher lever collage subjects, and take long time to finish the collage. Most of the students life get more complected way than they thought, for that unnessery rush in a wrong time. Most of the students face diffelticulties to reach their dream carriers.

Another thing is that there is like 2 question in 1 and the second question said does inactivity also serve a purpose?. And I think that yes because it's work like a goal, like you know for why you are doing what you are doing doesn't matter. So yeah I think that inactivity work for a purpose.

The benefits of working with a Group or working Alone.

Working with a group has a lot of benefits specially because there is many smart brains working with just one goal in mind, the good think is that they different than others and that helps to brings more ideas in the work, by working with groups, if somebody makes a mistake and doesn't know or don't notice the error his teammates can help him to fix all the bad errors that he had. When you work alone you don't have no body to check if you did something wrong or you put a bad information in some point of your work. Working in group could help to finish any job or project faster. The majority of the times a group of people always works better than just one person,.

Working in a group is very challenging because the persons who are in the group have a different way to think and a different way to work, for many people is difficult for them to try to learn a new way of thinking and leave the form of work that they been using in a long time and that they know it work for them. Learning to understand they way of how someone work and thinks is a very important skill if most of the time you work with groups. With the appropriate teammates a group can do great job; In the University's most of the projects they do are in groups, in the University many projects can became famous and helpful for the world, it can be because they found a way to clean the dirty water or they found a cure for the cancer.

In a group is very important the communication between the teammates, learn how to communicate with your partner is very important. When everybody gives an idea , the group can take three ideas out the 6 ideas that the group gave, everybody has a idea it can be important or a silly idea but from that silly idea it can be the important est in the group. Having patient is very important more if there is one teammate who does like you or disagree with, most of the problems it will be about who is right and who is wrong that is why the communication is very important. Groups with patient and communication always does a great work , sometimes that project it can be so important for the society .

In my personal experience of working with a group, it help me a lot to develop my skills of working with a group and always try to learn something new when the opportunity come to work with group. Learn from others ideas of how to plan something is very interesting because it's a challenge you to try to change the way you so you understand the way of how your teammates work and the how they lead a group. Working in group is like playing soccer , everybody has a roll to do in the work , like one it can be somebody who writes , who draws , who speak and finally who is the captain of the group. In soccer the captain decides who is going to play defense , and it's the same as work as group because the captain of the group can't put somebody and does not know how speak in the front ,and put the person who knows how to speaks to draw the model of the project.

Working Alone is very different and easier because you are your own boss , you can have any idea and you will no have somebody who will disagree with you. Working alone it will required hard work because you will have to do everything slower and step by step. planning it will be harder because you will have a lot of ideas but you will not know which is the best to work with , the pretense of finish a work alone is 50 % , and when you work with a group the percent is 75% of finishing the work at time and with great results. Most of the famous creations in the world it came for just one person who work alone and did his job a master piece.

Working in group is easier and come with a lot of benefits. Working in a group it helps to finish the job fast and with good results because many people agree that they did their best work and that everything is ok . Having everybody to agree with something is very difficult to do becuase they all work and think different from each other, it takes a long time think a idea and then make your teammates agree with you that is pretty good idea .

6850D8C2ADCB,"Some people believe in praising a student's work to build self-esteem, even if the work is not the students best efforts. They believe that students must be self-confident to learn. Others believe that praise given for deficient work undermines learning by lowering standards. They believe that the source of true self-esteem is achievement. For some students, it may be difficult to learn or just want to try minimum efforts. But some teachers like to praise students, and it might not always be good, because if teachers praise them, they will continue to do the same and never improve, as well as they could start to form an ego, also thinking their work is better than other students, as well as well as you have worked hard to accomplish that achievement that you have worked hard for without anyone telling you its good or bad.

If teachers start to praise students then the students will keep doing the same and never improve on their work or skills. "" Hey Generic_Name, your work looks very good, i am really liking that stick figure painting. Keep up the good work.""

Its good to give compliments to students, but when the teachers keep telling the students that they are doing everything great to not discourage the student, then the student will keep thinking that everything he does is great and will continue to do the same without any improving results, which most teachers are usually looking at is improvement.

Secondly, students can build an ego, which could make other students feel bad for what they are doing. "" Yo Generic_Name i got a seventy one percent, i see you got seventy percent on your math quiz."" This statement isn't true but could be for many different situations. Most of these type of things could apply to the younger audience of kids, who probably if the teacher would tell them they are doing something great but its not true it does and can happen. for bigger students like in middle school it can evolve into a bigger thing like fights or arguments. In high school a lot of teachers compliment you, but it goes back to you not improving, or students just not caring about it.

Lastly, if students do it themselves and have worked hard to get to that goal and have achieved it. "" I am Finally done and it looks good but could use some improvements."" If you have worked hard for something you feel good about once you have finished then you have completed an achievement, and students completing an assignment themselves without teachers praising something that students may not enjoy or be to happy about it. If a student completes it then he can find himself improving on little details that he may find odd in whatever the student is doing.

In conclusion, some people may believe that in praising a student's work it could build self-esteem, and others think it comes from achievements. some poeple enjoy to praise students, but if its just a lie to help the students build confidence, and self esteem, it can not be good for later on because it could have an effect on you or other people as well. Some students might get a bit of ego that could come in from certain people. but some students, feel more confident on what they are doing by themsleves without anyone telling them that its ""good"".

"" yo genericname i got a seventy one percent, i see you got seventy percent on your math quiz."" this statement isn't true but could be for many different situations. most of these type of things could apply to the younger audience of kids, who probably if the teacher would tell them they are doing something great but its not true it does and can happen. for bigger students like in middle school it can evolve into a bigger thing like fights or arguments. in high school a lot of teachers compliment you, but it goes back to you not improving, or students just not caring about it. lastly, if students do it themselves and have worked hard to get to that goal and have achieved it. "" i am finally done and it looks good but could use some improvements."" if you have worked hard for something you feel good about once you have finished then you have completed an achievement, and students completing an assignment themselves without teachers praising something that students may not enjoy or be to happy about it. if a student completes it then he can find himself improving on little details that he may find odd in whatever the student is doing. in conclusion, some people may believe that in praising a student's work it could build selfesteem, and others think it comes from achievements. some poeple enjoy to praise students, but if its just a lie to help the students build confidence, and self esteem, it can not be good for later on because it could have an effect on you or other people as well. some students might get a bit of ego that could come in from certain people. but some students, feel more confident on what they are doing by themsleves without anyone telling them that its ""good"". it can also give the student a better understanding on how to improve his work and skills.",4

first of all, technology had been helping discovering things that Scientific didn't know before for example the medicine Scientist didn't know the cure of each desease until the technology was inproving.

Many people died for diferent type of desease because they didn't have the cure or the right medicine for the illness, but now everything has been changed almost every illness has a cure thanks of the technology scientist have been discover many things that has been saving lives for many peoples and childrens in almost all the World.

Secondly, technology has been inproving each years and iventing new things . For example connecting peoples all over the world, before If someone has a familly in other Country the only way we used to connect with them was sending a letter or by traveling. But now everything has been changed If someone want to see a familly

In other County or State they just have to make a facetime call or send a email or text them and that is all they have to do.

If someone want to buy stuffs or order food they just have to order it on line and they will get it for them that is the faster way to do.

So in that way they don't have to spend time by going to the store or waiting for the food or making a line It just great.

In conclusion I think live is easier now with the technology, because it makes things faster, and has been helping descovering things that we didn't know before.

BD30C1CC1004,"I am agree with Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success, He said ""The success consists of going from failure to failure with out loss of enthusiasm"", and that really true , if everyone do not fail and try again, then they will not feel the pride of success and the pride of themselves. And here is 3 reasons, why did I agree with Churchill's statement: because people need to have attempt, patience, and self-confidence.

First, for everyone to be a successful, they need to have attempt and to try again and again. Do not stop trying, because if everyone is not trying there will be no success. Everyone has to try one time, two time, and more until they achieve their goals and be successful in the future. Also, try to not feel dissatisfaction from everything if you fail, when people try again they achieve their goals. And the failure create success

Second, for everyone to be a successful, they need to have patience. Everyone need a patience because they may encounter a lot of disaster in their life, but with patience everyone will arrival their dreams and be a successful person. Do not care about what people taking said , make their negative words to enthusiasm to complete your march. Do not never give up, be patience with difficulty disaster.

Third, for everyone to be a successful, they need to have a self-confidence, self-confidence is when anyone do something that they believe that is the right thing to do. And it is the most impotent thing everyone should have. Also, with belief and self-confidence everyone will make their dream true. A hope support self-confidence, and

Self-confidence reinforcements for your ambitious.

50296CC178CC,"I am agree with Churchill's stamement about the important role of failure, to pursuit success.

This is a really good statement that I've been using to motivate myself because failure it doesn't mean the End.

Churchill's idea is to motivate people that think that life is a failure when we attend to commit mistakes, and many people makes mistakes but we shouldn't stop learning from our mistakes to continue living our best life.

I get a lot of motivation every time I fail because I'm not perfect and if I learn from something that I'm not really good at it, I try to do my best and improve every time I fail.

Fail is for the people that doens't think big, Fail is for those who doens't enthusiasm themselves to be better in life but they think different and if they want to success in life they shouldn't stop failing because only losers quit.

Based on this stament the fails determine who you are and how do you think, because after the storm, there's always a rainbow.

Even though when you feel that nothing can help you to get up because is really difficult to start from zero to hero, but step by step is how you reach your goals, nothing comes easy there's always a chance that opens the gates to discover new paths. Just being positve, show attitude, and care about yourself nothing is going to stop you.

In conclussion, I'm agree with Churchill's stament because consistent people achieve their goals as soon as you chase your dreams, don't stop pushing, and putting effort to become better.

Although, it wouldn't be a bad idea if teenagers have a 10 p. m. weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew because they would get less in trouble, have a enough sleep, and have better time in studying.

Teenagers don't think when it comes to pass curfew at night they can get in trouble with their parents, or deal with the cops. Most of the teenagers think is not big deal, but really it is. I remember when I was thirteen I slept over to my friend house and we decide to go out at 11:00 p. m. to hangout with our friends. My friend and I didn't really care about curfew until, that same night, we both got in trouble with the police and our parents too. We got in trouble because both of us were out at 1:00 a. m., pass curfew, and our parents didn't know. Ever since that same night both of us don't go out pass curfew until we are eighteen and up.

It's good if teenagers have a 10:00 p. m. weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew because a lot of teenagers now and days don't have enough sleep. All humans need eight or more hours of sleep everyday for their health. Most teenagers only have 5 or less hours of sleep every night because they are out late with their friends, not following the curfew, and coming back home when they want too. I see kids all the time in my school sleeping during class, or really having bad under eyes and I just think it's important for us teenagers to have enough sleep. Teenagers who sleep during class are gonna miss important information on what the teacher is saying because that information can be on their test. Some teenagers get into car crash because they fall asleep on the wheel for not having enough sleep. A lot of teenager would sleep early if they follow the curfew and don't come home to late because no can go out pass curfew.

Now and days teenagers don't have time to study, or don't study at all when it comes to their test. Some teens go out drinking at night and don't realize it's pass their curfew, others go out late, say they are gonna come back and study, but really they don't. Teenager who don't study are the ones that don't have curfew because they know they can come home when they want too and not even have to worry about getting in trouble at all.

My position on this issue, I think students would not benifits from being able to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, because schools programmes its helping you to get more informations, learning more things to get high level.

For example when you attend classes in the schools it will be conversations between the teachers and students about the term than you will benifits more informations and working between students like a groups its reason to get more knowledge.

attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing you will not have attention like in schools classrooms because the teachers they helping you to understand and explaine more.

When you have a research at schools attend classrooms you can use technology and books and you can work like groups it will be more easy to do your research. But when you have attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing you will not have a conversation between others students to get more knowledge.

In my opinion, I prefer schools attend classes because when you focus with the teacher you will understand more about the term. For expample in my english class i pay attention at the class i can understand, and when i have a questions i ask my teacher to explaine for me.

I desagree with students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Some courses you can't take it at home because you you need to worked like a groups. For example when i have work to do at schoul classroom's we work together to make the exrcises or a topic easy, and when you get absent and you left some works the teachers helping you to do it.

The schools classrooms programmes will help you about the time and they have specific time to work confortable and to know what have to do, some students they need support from they teachers and counselors to make sure they do alright. For example when i need support my teachers they support and they give me enough time to make i understand everythings.

DBC04530D2F9,"Have your ever ask yourself what makes a person's character?. Some People think that a person's character is define by their actions and by what their selves choose to. While others think that character is form by influences beyond control. I agree that as individuals our character is influenced beyond our control because of , internet influence, fit in society , and by actions.

One reason why character is influence beyond control is because people get influenced by internet platforms. Internet platforms in influence in many ways some could be good , while other not quit so. Character is influence by social medias posts , YouTube videos and variables of things. These kind of things interfere with a person characteristic people might want to follow and do what they see on internet. a person might not even be awarded that they are being influence by internet.

second claim why a person's character is influence beyond control is because they get influence by society. People might feel that to fin in society they have to have the same characteristics and act the same as others to be accepted and tolerated by society. People who is pressure by others would act and do things that they know are no specifically good. For example you are a very respectful and kind person but they you turn into a not so kind person their has to be something making you changed the way you are and that could be other people , changing your character.

Lastly people's characteristics are influence beyond control because of the actions they take in life.

People's actions influenced the way they are and act. By taking good actions your character will be defined in a positive and understandable way. good actions will be the key into having authentic and unique character.

In conclusion there are many factors that influence that a person's character.

think high school offer those programs to young students that wants to graduate in early age and other students take this programs, because they want to graduate to continue with college or work to help their families. In other cases students just took these courses because they don't likes school .

But however their are always students that decide to complete high school in four years to have full credits to go at the best colleges. These students that take high school in four years are more prepared to colleges and they have more probabilities to get a better job.

For me take school in three years is a bad choice, because you learn a few less.

Examples:If you take school in three years and if you don't have the result that you wanted than you are gonna think that was a bad choice in your life.

8B155840CA6D,"Summer is the time for students to take a break from school, but some educators feel that summer break is too long and it needs to be shorten. As for me, I am strongly disagree with this idea because summer is the time for student to visit their famiy, their relatives, to do whatever they like, to enjoy whatever they love and sometimes learning too much might be somthing that some students could not handle.

First of all, summer is the time for students to come back to their hometown to visit their family. Some students, like me, came from another country so a lot of times we do miss our hometown. That is why having a three month summer break is truly a huge chance for us because that is pretty much the only reunion we have in a year. I will take mine as an example. To be able to come back to Generic_City it is not just about time, sometimes it could involve money. The ticket is just too expensive, not to mention that it is in summer. So if I can visit my family this year, I might have to wait a few years later to be able to visit them again.

Secondly, this is a period of time where students can do whatever thay want to do like doing some volunteering or club activities or playing sports or just simply doing their favorite hobbies. If we shorten the summer break, students will easily get bored when they come back to school because they do not have enough time to do what they like in summer. Nobody wants to study when they are bored. So if we want a student to return to school with lots of energy, we need to let them have a break. And that give me an example. One of my Vietnamese friend told me that even in summer he still have to take a lot of tutor classes. That is why if we shorten the summer break then lots and lots of Asian students will not even have time to do what they love!

Last but not least, learning too much might be something that some students could not handle. A short summer break meaning we have to go to school more than we need. I know that if we shorten the summer break we will have a longer winter break, but that is not the case for the country that does not have a winter break or a week off in fall and spring. A student could get stress if they do not have a proper break. Just check some examples on the news or internet, especially in South Korea or Japan. A lot of students suicide just because of learning too much. Too many homeworks and tests, pressures from parents and teacher,.... Very stressful! Not to mention that Asian students usually have a shorter summer break and winter break.

On the whole, I am not agree with this idea and along with fact that I am an Asian and I used to go through a very strict and tough education in Asia, I can never accept this.

5735C890E3C7,"As much as I love being lazy, I support the fact that everyone should be active all the time. Some might say having some rest is good, but too much rest is not good all the time. The phrase ""being active"" has different meaning for different types of people, as of for me I define it as studying or doing my homework or even doing my chores but for some people it might be doing their jobs or researching or even helping out others.

Being active has changed as time changed, long before technology a lot of people worked actively, they didn't have social Medea, phones, computers or even emails, they did everything hand by hand but nowadays almost everyone sites at home and let technology takes control, this has both bad and good effect but the bad side takes the majority effect. These bad effects brought health problems like; obesity, diabetics and so on. Being active can also be working out.

I believe, if someone works actively towards achieving their goals, they can accomplish anything they want(if it is realistic of course). We can see some famous scientist like Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawkins and Thomas Edison that worked day and night to prove something for the society and I believe these people changed the way that we are living right now.

I thot to my self one day maybe I could go for the solo wourld wrecord. I tryed my hardest but didnt even come close to geting it. But I lerned a lot that attempt to I tryed again and failed again. All tho I keepet failing every game I played I got closer to my goil of the solo wourld wrecord. almost two years later a finly acheved the world wrecord. I could not have done this with out failing over a hundred times and never giving up.

Failer bildes carictor in peaple and helps them devolop as a inovidual. If some one never fails in there life they woun't have what is needed to be succes full when the time comes. Further more peaple who tened to be natraly good at things also tend to have inflated egos along with them being very narsustic. This tipe of mind set will never alow you to be able to push your self. With out pushing your self you will never fail thus you will never avance your goil.

8279A3CD5E68,"Should students graduate from High School early? In the actuality, there are so many cases where students at the age of 17 years old are graduating early. Few of them gets tired, or even bored to study. In the other hand, most of those students thinks that it is an efective idea of taken a whole year off, by working hard to pay their own bills, or even saving money to pay their studies. But, it is not the ""best""option either. Students should not graduate early from High School because they do not accelerate their life, grow their knowledege, and plan their future.

To begin, through this period of time, students used to think about finishing High school as soon as possible. At this point, students should realized that everything takes time. Why do they accelerate their life? Why do they have to rush their education? I believe that students should complete their four years of High School, since, they are going to be able to think about what they really want to study. Decide just for one career to study in college it is not that easy. For example, a student had been thinking about study engineer his whole life. But, at the end, he found out a hobby that became his passion. So, that student has not a clear idea about what career he should choose, and which college he should applied. That's why that student will find out through this four years which option will be benefit for his future. In additon, each student will be capable to make an efective decision without any regret.

Second of all, students will have the capacity of growing up their knowledge. Since, each day they get to learn new topics from their teachers. Which is efective, because it is going to be worthy for college, since, its homework is more explicit, and extense. It is the opposite from high school. But, if students gets everything what they had learn in high school, it is not going to affect them at all.

Most of them, exploit this four years of high school to organizing their ideas. I believe that it is efective to have a clear perspective, nor mentallity of what you want to become in your new stage of your life.

For example, looking,and applying for schoolarships, since, some students do not have enough money to pay it. Also, they are able to planify their future by limiting their ""wants"", since, paying a college, here in the U.S., it is expensive. Furthermore, students start being mature, and use to be more responsible, since, they already know what they really need in their own life to succeed.

In conclusion, students should complete their high school without rushing. Of the fact of getting knowledge from teachers is benefitial, since each day we learn new things. And, being organize with your schedule, planify your ideas. It will be helpful on the career you choose.

2F439149E85C,"Someone who is constantly doing something can accomplish more? Or does inactivity also serve a purpose? This brings me back to my middle school days, where I was failing math class. Everyday I was lazy to study. Falling asleep in class and not taking notes really wasn't the best idea. After, home from school I would not bother doing my homework. A few weeks have gone by and my grade was going downhill. I was shocked I've gotten an F but not surprised. Sitting around and doing nothing was definitely not going to get me anywhere. Bringing up the grade was the first thing I had to do. My professor Generic_Name gave me advice, she told me to practice and study. Her advice helped me improve. Weeks later, my grade went up to a B, I couldn't be any happier. Sometimes an inactive person may still accomplish something but doesn't mean we shouldn't be active people. For example, my 16 year old cousin Generic_Name on the basketball team in his high school, always missed his basketball practices and wouldn't work out, yet his team would always win games. Eventhough, inactivity can still lead you to accomplishments, being active all the time will get you further than others because more tasks may be done, you'll stay motivated, and more opportunities will be available to you.

First of all, when you get a job, your boss will not hire you if you seem like a very lazy person. Someone with a very inactive life will be seen as unmotivated and will not take the job seriously. For instance, my mom a former cook at a Mexican restaurant, once came home very tired I asked her why was she looked unhappy, her reply was that no one at work gets anything done,they ignore the boss, use their cellphones and don't know how to take orders. Therefore, she gets payed extra because she takes her job more serious than her coworkers. She told me that when I get a job not to fall in their footsteps and to stay on task because I would get fired. It really isn't as hard as you might think when it comes to completing something, the more you do the better the chances you are to accomplish.

Secondly, by even just trying and doing something, we learn more than those who decide to just give up and sit around. Sometimes we have to push ourselves to do more than we think we can. Our minds tell us we can't do it but in reality we can achieve great things but you need to know that it's not going to happen out of the blue. There is no purpose in accomplishing without doing something to get there. Determining to stay active is something we will need to consider for the rest of our lives. Inactivity never serves a purpose to us because it keeps us from achieving wonderful things in life.

Although, many people get away with their unmotivation and still get somewhere, it has no meaning. But does that mean we should just not try at all and expect to get things done? Absolutely not, never listen to those who say that because that will make you lose motivation.

He be come a incorrigible person with anyone try to stop him.

The people don't have to go to another one house. They just use the phone to call them and ask if they don't good. Because of the technology we don't have to see each other. They think it's enough to talk in the phone or call each other video call. Before the technology everyone used to go see their family at home.

The New York Times

, more than 25% of teeneger died everyday in car accidents while their are on the way to school. Today apperently students are the most common target. They are not only risking thier lives in the way to school, also they are not safe there. ""Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing."" The best way for sudents to learn more and be safe is taking classes online because students will concentrate more in their required classes, and they will spend more time with their family.

First, students will concentrate more in their required classes. I knew a guy in El Salvador, he was recently graduated from High School, in four months he was going to start college, but it was two hours away from his home. He found out that he had the option to take classes online. He told me about the experience he had, he said that it was very cool becuase he could concentrate more, and classes are more fluent that allow students to learn more and, also help students to find more about themselves. Of not being afraid to talk, thinking that others students will make fun of them, student can have the chance to fell free of self-expressions It also give students the opportunity to meet new people.

Second, parents will be more calm knowing that thier children are in home safe, instead of being worry that something bad could happen to them. As is good for students it also parents has the adventage. About one years ago my aunt has a experience with her son. The school that he goes was being shot aproximally seven students were shot, and three students died, the school were closed for one week she was afraid send him back to school, so she decided to pay classes online to him. She said that it was going to be more expensive, but dhe wants the best for her son. after three month she saw how her son was improving better then when he was assiting at school. Also they have more time to expend time with the family.

Some people may say, that students who take classes online would not experiment real life, and when they decide to come to the real world it will be so hard to adat themselves, or when they start working they would not have any clue how to treat with the people around them. However if students take classes online they will be more related with new people, and more easier to find a good job.

6FEF08E3FC60,"Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss enthusiasm."" I'm agree with Churchill's statement about how important is the role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. I feel those are a really strong words ,and have a deep meaning for people who always keep trying ,and never give up.

Passing the years, we can appreciate how this statement it's certainly very true, Famous people who now are in the history, made mistakes and failure, some of then were even rejected. All this persons have something in common ,the way how they reached their goals, fighting against any adversity. we have the case of one of the best bands in the history, The Beatles how they were rejected and some people said they didn't have a chance in the industry of music , but they kept trying, and they accomplish their goal; now they are in the history of music.

Another thing that we have to know, is that failure doesn't mean that we won't have another chance, if we take it in a good way when we make mistakes we learn from them. Strong and smart people know that nothing comes easy, meaning we have to give the best of us to accomplish what we want. The last thing we have to loss is hope and enthusiasm, if we never lost those two things; it doesn't matter how many times we fall we are always going to stand up and try again till we get the success we want.

In addition, if you want to be successful you will have to take away any distraction that can make you failure. You will know that you are on the right path to get what you want when you feel everything is hard, the things that we want the most, are the ones who cost the most.

in conclusion we never have to stop trying, every time we want something we have to fight to the end for it.

Take the good examples that we have around is a good way to realized that if we never loss hope and enthusiasm we'll get what we want. I don't know any strong and successful person who had a easy way to get success, follow Churchill's thought and you'll get far.

CFEC920440CE,"We accomplish more by doing tasks that we are assigned with to complete.

We have always get something done if the tasks or assignments are done.

Take for example people that work jobs, day and night they tend to get work or tasks or assignments done.

How do they get stuff done, workers usually plan it out like steps to go though to complete them if they dont follow the steps like how are they going to complete the task or assignment to get it done. Workers always need to plan it out before proceeding to the task or assignment to finish or complete. For example Generic_Name wants to figure out how to complete his project, he need to plan step by step and what materials he needs for the project. He follows the step by step plan but realizes what he needs to do later on he gathers the materals and starts to complete his project just by always doing it.

All of us always have to something to complete any tasks or assignments to finish.

It's not going to work if we dont always doing something or plan it out , it's the reason why if you wanna get it stuff done you have always do it in order complete it. For example take school students for a example, they tend to always to get work done so they can free time to themselves and usually making sure the answers they write down are correct to get good grades. School students have determation to complete classwork they're assigned to, so later on they don't have to complete it for homework at home for free time. It's better to always complete work so you don't have to complete later on. For example any job work usually has work to do like car manufactures , they have a assembly to work on because it's where the cars are starting to be made by the workers in the assembly line. They have to work the machines to put the parts on the cars that are being work on so it can shipped of to the car dealership. Everything revolves around on always getting something on time, so it doesn't become a problem later on. Everyone like to job workers to school students alwayss have to something , its why we tend to get stuff done.

Always accomplish it by doing it

Reasons why, we have to do it if we tend to get our task or assignments done then that work doesn't get it the way of what you are trying to on the next task. Accomplishing that we are trying to get to is a good way to start off, you see like CEOs of a company planning what they want done and to figure it how to accomplish it.

People always have to plan to work towards to they want to achieve or accomplish even for their future. it's not going to work if you don't put the effort into the assignment or tasks to make it happpen.

Technology has had a big effect on humans from adults to toddlers all around the world in schools and in many other environments. With less communication due to technology may cause conflicts between people. You may have not been able to comprehend what was said or happened because you werent communicating. Not communicating causes people not to understand what you mean or where you are coming from in any situation if its in a relationship or friendship. Communication is something everyone should be comfortable to do and know about.

You dont really get to enjoy life as much because with technology you dont really focus on anything else that is happening around you. When your at family events you may be on your phone and not focusing on your family enjoying dinner, making funny jokes or opening up about something new and important to them. You may be at school and miss on all school events or the kindness of people around you.

5BF7AAC78AB5,"Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that "" success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" I agree with Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. Just like saying ""if you want to know everything you got to not know anything first."" , ""if you want to be rich you got to be poor first."" , ""You got to learn how to walk before you run.""

Every people that are smart, rich and well-know there are all born without any of that just like every single one of us, no one is perfect. We all have something that we are good at and something that we are bad at.

The way to successful is not hard to get there. Do what you are good at. Make sure you are enjoin what you are doing. Just like this one man that I forgot his name said ""get a job that you are enjoin doing it, a job that you have fun doing it and you will jump out of the bed in morning.""

You are who you are right now because of all the mistake you make in the pass. ""success consists of going from failure to failure."" you lean from your mistake. If you never do anything wrong that mean you never do anything at all. All the mistake you make you better because you lean from it. You can also lean form another people mistake too. It's one of the reason why most of thing in world got better.

Soccer is the sport that I like. I'm not that good at it but not that bad either. When I first start playing I don't know a lot about it so I keep playing unit I know a little bit more about it. Then I start playing with the pro player because I know that I'm gonna make a lot of mistake and all those mistake gonna help lean how to play and how to get better and it does. I make a lot of mistake I still do but I like to take a hit sometime it make me stronger. you know what they say ""what doesn't kill you make you stronger."" so I keep trying and trying hope that I can make that to be my job. Mistake dose help you it may be a big one something or a small one but all the mistake help you. I was really bad at soccer once but now I petty good at it.

All of this should explain why Churchill said that""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" Mistake is a part of you it's a part of everything but it's not all way bad.

I believe not everyone has something to do over the 3 months of summer break.

It will be easier for people to hold the information when they return in the fall. A large amount of people forget what they learn in school when they return from the 3 months of summer break.

When we get 3-4 weeks over summer break, not all the information will leave. It will be easier for us students to not forget what we learned over the months.

School days will be shorter since the school year is longer or we can have one weekday off and have school at a regular time. They can change it so students don't have to wake early in the morning. Some people can't wake up early and some people get off work late and have school the next day. Students can have one weekday off, like a Wensesday or Friday off. It will give them time to relax and stay focus on school. Since, the school days are shorter, they can have time to theirselfs and not be stressed.

I believe not everyone has something to do over the three months of summer break. They might just do something for one month and for the another two months might not do anything. They might just stay inside and play video games all day and not read or not pick up a book the whole break. They might not even exercise all day. Students need to have something to do over the breaks, so they can keep learning.

Sometime I believe it's a bad idea. Students will stay a school the whole year until they gradute, and they need to spend time with their family. Some students don't really like school and they will get too stressed and breakdown over the year, so they need a long break from school. Students need time for theirselfs, so they don't stress as much. Students will stress over too much work and they have after school jobs, so they can't do their homework.

Having 3-4 weeks of summer break, a longer winter, and a week off in the spring and fall is a great idea. It will be easier to hold the information when you return in the fall.

Because there are advantages, and some disadvantages about technology. Some advantages are that they make things easier around use,most things are faster to use. Some disadvantages are people are addicted to technology like cell phones computers laptops video games.

The limitation for technology good in ways where people can interact with one another instead of texting all the time, or being on there phones. Also getting to know each other and catching up on things. Technology has many impacts, but however its useful in so many ways. But people have to learn how to use it wisely because many people in collage or high school get really addicted to there phones a lot, and get off track with it and not focus on there school work and always on there phones.

Technology in school is really useful like iPads or mac books. Because it get work done fast and its better than writing things down. Also we can watch school related videos to teach us how to learn things, and some people find it better to do or if the teacher gives us educational games to play online or as a class. But sometimes too much of it isnt good because students end up going on something else. If people limit technology I feel like the way people interact would be different in a way.

B3B9D116021C,"People tend to think that setting a goal high to achieve is a smart idea. While the other side thinks that setting a goal low is the better. Although some people may hate setting a goal high and falling short, it can cause a person to give up, but they forget to neglect the part that goals or achievements come in different shapes and sizes. People should be aiming their achievements high because people can achieve more, people can feel more motivated, and people can feel more successful.

Some people may not agree with this position because setting a goal to high and then falling short can cause a person to feel less motivated. they believe this because when setting a goal high and it fails, it can make a person give up and not try. they may think this because when giving up on a goal it can cause a person to feel empty and wanting to not try again. this shows that some people are afraid of failing, and when they do fail it makes them not try again. However, the oppositions looks over other important points.

People should be aiming their achievements high so they can achieve more. when a person sets their goal high, it could mean they are setting multiple goals and not just one, having one goal is great, but having multiple is also fantastic. this can also make the person feel good about themselves, knowing that they have accomplished more than one achievement. it can also make them feel proud about themselves. Even if a person failed one goal that doesn't mean they can't accomplish other goals. People cannot accomplish every goal, all goals are different then one another, but other harder goals can be accomplished.

people should be aiming their achievement high because it can make a person feel more successful. Once a person has completed an achievement it can make them as if they succeeded. it can also help with their confidence, it would give them less anxiety. it also shows that the person who is working towards his or her achievement can do so much more. it can also help some people in the future because they have the confidence they need because they hit different goals. people can also feel like they did something with their life and not feel like they did not accomplish anything in life.

People should aim their achievements high because they can feel more motivated. Setting an achievement means working really hard. It means you must focus on, it should be the only thing you are working on. Most people in their mind focus on this and this is what motivates them to work on one persons goal. In their brain they get this sense of energy, their brain is telling them to work on their goal. that is what make some people want to work towards their goal or try to finish their goal.

So this is why aiming your goal high is a good thing, motivation, success and achieving more can help a person in life if trying complete an achievement. People can get scared of goals, they are afraid it could fail something could go wrong, but the thing is in life you will fail, nobody is perfect, people will have get over their fears and accomplish their goal.

946D8B23ECA6,"I agree with Albert Einstein when he said that imagination is more important than knowledge. within you knowledge comes you imagination. in that imagination you see that it will help you receive your knowledge from somewhere that you did imagined. even tho sometime you imagination can mess your Brain a little when you go ahead of yourself. Like when you think about a subject that takes you way over that your brain wont handle itself.

but mabey sometimes your knowledge can be more efficient than your imagination because your brain is acting more mature when it comes to obstacles that are difficult. your brain acts more when its come to a problem like that time you got stuck on that question on that math test you've taken. sometime even when you are reading a book. reading a book may help you vocabulary when you read.

but there're time when they both help each other. both knowledge and imagination can help when you construct something. mabey you wanted to built something but you had no idea what. thats why you have you imagination comes right on in to tell you many ideas on what to build. once you think of the build you knowledge is there to help out to figure out on how you should build it. your brain get all the knowledge to help to build that dimension of the building there s how both can work together,

but still there're some negative times when it come to imagination and knowledge. like that time you are felling a bit down and your imagination said that you cant find anything to make you happy. sometime when your imagination goes a bit to far like that time you play with friends when you were younger you can make thing a bit unfair with your imagination and can loose that friend. in middle school with that knowledge of yours can change many things on a test. you can do good or bad. but say you did good and you were the student that had the highest score but you friend go one of the lowest score but you bragged about it yo can also loose that friend.

E3097287CBD1,"Some school offer distances learning as an option for student to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I think student would not be benefit if they had distances learning. Many student would not focused during the lesson they would just do whatever they want so they won't learn as much as if they had a teacher. If student had online classes they would not get the attention necessary if they need help.

Some student often have a bad day so they often don't pay attention and they just don't do the work that is assigned to them. they often just search the answer without learning but they think that's okay because no one is watching them. Many of them don't learn the subject but still somehow they passed the class. Other Important, reason why student won't benefit from online classes is that the may have some big problem in their life and they need someone to talk to but their one home so they feel sad, but if they were in school they can talk to a teacher,coach,counselor, or any other they feel happy to talk too. Other student may be sad they don't have someone to talk too.

Online classes don't benefit students because they don't have the help they need. When student take online they can paid someone to do their work, and pretend that they did the work. One reason they can ask their brother to the work for them so they are not really learning anything. Other example, student may request some extra help but they won't get it because they don't a teacher with them. so they just don't understand but when it comes to do the text they failed. Other example might be that they are having family problem so they won't do the online classes. And they would not be focus. Having online classes won't help student in their life. one example is that they won't have friends and when they go to the real world they are going to have trouble talking to people because they don't know how too. Other important reason why school should not have online classes is that many student need to talk to a counselor for that they want to be when they grow up. and most. Most counselor guide their student the right way they teach the career we want to have in our life. but they take online classes they don't have the opportunity to chat with them.

When students get video conferencing they don't really understand because something the video don't really explain what the student want to learn. one reason is the student might feel lazy to replay the video so he does not understand. and if he was at school teacher would help them with all their work . School should not have video conferencing.

Student are going to feel bad when they get older that they took online classes.. one reason they going to feel bad is that they did not enjoy high school life. let's Image if a student was really good at soccer or any other sport and if they had played high school they could of get a scholarship, and maybe become one of greatest,

but they did'it because they were talking online classes. school should not have online classes because it take the right of student in playing high school sport.

Overall, student would not benefit from online classes. they won't learn that much at home, and student need the attention to do work, they also need people to help them with their work.

Also, in the technology you can find stranger people that they want to do bad things. And you don't know if you will be their victim or you can not trust in they becasue you don't know wthat the person is traying to do with. Is not a good idea spend a lot of our time using the technology, we have to spend time with our family, take a brake of the technology do ohers things with friends, visit new places to learnd about the real life to feel more better. We don't just need the technology to be happy or a good person we can be happy and a better person doing different things everyday. When you use just the technology you can be an addicted person to it.

After that, in the technology you can do projects serch for somethings that you don't know and find information but you can also ask for help to other students, teachers, or a person that know about it. When we use a lot the technology we forget about others things that can help us to be a good person in life. For examples, in years later people just use books to find information, they write in papper with their hands they doesn't had machine to type. When they want to communicate they write letters and send far away to the families, friends or something like that. And through the years it change, we don't send letters to our family that is far away we just use the technology to communicate with the others. Most of we don't read newspapper, we don't go to library or other things. Today we just use the techonology to do all most everything.

Therefore, some people think different than what I think, and have others opinion about the technology. In one hand some people says that the technology has good ideas for them. An example, they can meet people from others contries, places and through the technology have new frinds because when they spend a lot of time using the technology they don't have contact with others that are arround or close to them, they just spend in a room without friends. In the other hand some people just use the technology to read book, newspapper either shop things or they work through the internet. Also, childen use the technology to play games, for youtube chanels and others things.

In addition, you should use the technology for everything and don't ask for help to others. When you use the technology you learn a lot of bad and good things but you can choose wich ones do you want to do for your life. You can use the internet to do good things like help others, either bad things like steal money or somethings like that. People think if you use the technology and you are intelligent you can help people teaching how to use the technology and we choose the things that are able to help us in the future for be better person in life. The people who like spend most their time in front a computer or phones their opinion are differnt because they like use the technology everyday or everytime in their lives.

Finally, use the technology has positive and negative effects on people's life. Some people use the technology to help others or they use it to find information that they want and need about projects or something else. When we use the technology we are responsibles in what we do during use the internet. Others people use the technology just for fun, play games, movies or something in common. In conclusion, the technology the technology has advantage and disadvantage. Also has negative effects in life because some people are almost addictive to the internet and they use a lot it, in the future maybe some people can have mental problems or insomnia owing to the technology. In fact we can have an especifict time to use the technology but with limitation having an expecifit excess of time.

So i think the students should have a community service. The principal should required the students to have a community service. If students would decide to have community service they would do a awesome job by helping out residents and helping out the environment because your helping it out by not letting that much trash get in to our world. You would help the plants by letting them grow more and live more. Then will have much more food and vegetables. So i think having a community service is good so will help out the environment to stay clean and have a better and cleaner community.

457549C51576,"This page i will be writing about, if curfew for teenagers is a good or bad thing for them. curfews for teens is not a good thing.

Curfew for teens isn't a good thing it dose not entirely mean, just cause there's a curfew teens would stay home it would cause them to want to sneak out, parents would loose trust with there child. It is taking the fun out of young teen's teenage lives away from them not allowing them to have fun while they are young. my parents have told me no when i ask them to go out when its late and if i do i have to be home before a certain time and home early therefore, i dont think its fair at all for us teens we should be able to at least go out sometimes without having to be home so early.

Kids at that age should be allowed to have fun at night without a curfew yes they should be safe late night but making sure there home before ten o'clock is way out of hand and should not be a thing its taking fun away from them while there still young.

It takes teenagers opportunities away to work longer hours at night making them work in the day when they already have, school, homework to do later on in the day and if they have any activities such as, sports, clubs or even, take care of there younger siblings it put's a lot on there back and stresses them out.

Even though people say teens should not go out at night to party but they are wrong, teens need to have fun here and there its never wrong to let your kid go out at night and have some fun with friends and also work late shifts if they have to.

62B3C9C3398E,"Do we have to live other people experiences?

If we want to live our own life you should start by taking a break. Think how people would like to live their lifes and then, use this as an example but do not use it for your own. We all know that life isn't easy as we want but that's life, we cannot change it. If you put your life in hands of an expert you will have the opportunity to succed but it will feel strange and you will regret later. Why? if you ask why, and this is because everything you have done it's thanks to someone else not to you, you are not living your own life, youar not having fun, no mistakes, no experiences, no control of your own life. There's always going to be a person telling you what to do and if you don't follow his/her directions something could go wrong. That's why you should live your life as you want to live it without anybody help. At first, you can have a teacher during a period of time but it doesn't mean that you will have to go and ask for help everytime you have a problem. Make your own decisions mean that you will do mistakes but you will learn even more from this and it will help you to do thigs better and it also will help you like a human. When I said human I mean that you will have your own thoughts about something and your own way to live your life and no like a robot that just follow direction and have no sense of humor.

People will never discover their great mental power because until I know they just develop the 70.3% of their mental capacity and it makes them feel useless sometimes. I don't really like to talk about other people life but one example could be Homeless people. Everyone thinks and look at the as a piece on somethings useless but if you really meet them and talk to them you will realize that they are smart and all they do and what they have in their brains is even better than what we have. The way they think and the way they look at other people make them specials and unique. Now, what can experts do to change their life or take the control of what they want to do?. As we all know, they cannot do anything and no matter what the situation could be the answer will be the same. Their decisions and their style of life before the actual I think were made by someone else and after a while they were not able to pay for what they had. Experts help you to get things but do you really think they will help you when you are really on trouble? or will they help you with things you have to pay? the answer to this is NO. In my opinion they help you because they want something from you or they will try to get something from you after you learn it. Two years ago I met an old man from Washington DC, his name was Generic_Name. His parents are from Generic_City and Generic_City. Before homeless he was a mechanic but one day while he was fixing a car he met a person who told him that he could help him to have his own workshop and he accepted. Everything was good for the first years but after some years the person left the country and Generic_Name didn't have the capacity to manage the whole store. Bussiness came down, deppression started to make him use drugs, and after a while he lost everything he had and the expert (person who help him) wasn't there to help him when he really needed him.

If you think you have the capacity to succed on your own, you have to do it and don't let anyone ruin what you have planned for your own future. It doesn't matter if he is a proffesional, you just need to learn what you need but never let them maneuver your life. People will always try to control your life but you are the one who is going to decide if you want to live the life they want you to live or the one you want to live. I am not saying that you have to ignore the advices they give you but don't follow their directions.

Nothing is difficult if you really try it and nothing can be impossible if you really want to do it. Do not live like a robot, don't let anyone take adventage of your incapacity to succed just because you do not know anything. Ask questions, ask for advices and opinions but don't do want they want to do with your life. I know life isn't easy to live but remember that we just have one and after death we cannot do anything about it. Life is going to beat you up, experiences will make you stronger every single day, decisions will make you be independent, and at the end you will see that everything you did was good and you have what you wanted without anybody help. My friend, if you let people maneuver your life, then you will cry and you will not have the future you wanted. Everything will be destroyed and disgrace will follow you anywhere.

Don't follow experts, be one of them and do your own life, have a family, have a car, an partment or whatever you want to have without asking anyone. Help is given by God when you born. He gave you two arms, two legs, two eyes and a body. A person help you to walk and talk and one time you learn this you become an indepentent person. Do everything by yourself and don't let people make you feel useless because God make them the same as you and as everyone else but they have not develop their mental capacity the waht make them special. If you do everything by yourself people will try to destroy you but be strong and try even more until get what you want. Never try to kill yourself if you don't know what to do it is better if you believe in God and in his help because he is the only one who can help you without taking anything away from you.

Never give up and follow your dreams, live your life as you want to live it but remember that no one can control what you can do if you don't want to. Life depends of you and what you do with it. No matter what happen you have to do what makes you happy always just trusting God. Remember that just God and family are our friends. Anyone else is just people we know.

8D00FE53EC71,"Should students identify a career by the time they enter high school at a young age? do you agree or disagree

I'm disagree because they still too young to get a career and they just enter high school, and to be in career is a lot of responsibility, and they still need to learn more to be in career, because learning a career is like they are learning a job, and to learn about a job that you want to do for the rest of your life you need to know more like they did just enter to high school you need to learn more and be preparation and i think the grades has to be A, B, C, I think that how their grade has to be and when they grade are good and they are passing they can be in a career when they are in 10 grade but not in 9 grade so that's why i'm not agree because they can not came to high school and get a career and 50% of the students in 9 grade they are not passing their class to get a career.

First they are some students that just enter to high school and they still don't know about responsibility, and career is a lot of responsibility, and it's only for junior and seniors and when they are in

10 grade if they had English 10 they can sign in for a career, and get ready for a career, and they can choice what ever career they want like be a nursing, mechanic ,and etc and they can choice like to career and what ever they say that they can choice they will study for it.

Second if they are 16 years old they can choice a career, but if they are not 16 years old they can not choice a career they are still young but still like 50% of the students in 10 grade they don't give them a change to be in a career like me they did not have me a change I want to be a nursing but they did not have a change, and now i think i will to college and study to be a teacher or I don't really know because at the same time I think ""I want to be a famous"" like try to be in a movie or I don't really know what career i want to be in I'm junior and I still don't know what career I want to take because they did not have us other choices to study about, I wish we could had other choices to study in school not like nursing because other students that they want to be other things, but if we application to be a nursing it doesn't always have everyone at school a opportunity, they are some students that they want to be nursing and they applicate and they don't have them a chance but if that students doesn't study more, they will not have him/her the opportunity to study for nursing so my opinion is that they should not allow students that they just enter to school get a career.

third I think that they should talk with them about career before they are in 10 grade and ask them if they are really to sign in for a career and they should think about what career they want to be in, but they are still young they should not be in young age if the are 16 years old or older them 17 they should allow to choice a career, bu if they are not older them 16 years old they should not allow what career they want to do they should talk to them about career but leave them choice a career.

My opinion is that they should not let them choice a career because they are still to young and they need to know more about responsibility like they should start learning about responsibility my best friend Generic_Name she is in 9 grade, and she know about responsibility she take care of her little brother and she know what career she want to be she want to be a soccer player she is good in soccer and she is so nice and good friends they should be more 9 grades like my best friends that they already know about responsibility and they are 9 grades that they don't even respect the teacher and their family so that means that they still don't know about responsibility, and they should respect the teacher and their family because that show that they know about responsibility, some students that they enter to high school they don't respect even students from 10, 11 ,12 grade so that's why they should not allow thme selected a career first they had to show respect to they teacher, family, and their self.

Let's be honest working with group is better, this can be more beneficial that work alone, but most of the teachers ask this question at their students because they want better results in their works. Working with a group is more beneficial for many reasons the topic is to discuss with different persons in the group, this can be better and they can do the assignment in a little time and work with a group is more entertaining cause they can talk and listen the rest of the group.

When they work with a group the project is more interesting because more opinions they can listen and analyse any of them, this can be good and strengthen the project, each person in this world take things in differenst forms and when they work with a group this happen, but and any reason this help cause each person in the group work in different forms when they knowledge what they can do it better, everybody take their position start working together, loving, doing, and enjoying with a total concentration.

The work will be better because the differents forms for work that will be a benefits for the group and the project because that will be more easy for the same reason, more people, more help each person have the responsibility to help each other cause they are a group, this one is another benefits. In this point the assignment take least time for do it work together, helping each other make the assignment look better and different hope time.

Enjoying the time working with others persons, is other benefits, they feel happy and comfortable. When they work with their friends the time is amazing for them, this make entertaining and funny. Friendship can be better for work together more confidence, share moments with that people that they appreciate will be a good idea and will be help for their carrying out in the group and this one is other thing for that reason work with a group is more beneficial than work alone.

Many times the people when they work together is not exactly good idea, everything in a sense have a bad point because some person do not help to their group, they do not have interest for the assignment, simply forget help and contribute.

D6C9DE61BAF4,"There are three examples about if I agree or desagree about the statement ""It has been said that a positive attitude is the key success in life"". I agree with this statement about the importance of attitude and I will give some reasons.

Firts example, one reason that why I agree with this statement is because,if you want to apply for a job, you need to have a positive attitude to be sucessful for other people because they want to see the best of you and if you can have that job and how you relate with other people and you will see the results about it . Many people with bad attitude are lay off of their work because at work you have to show your best attitude with the costumers,boss or with other workers but some people don't do it . If you are the boss, you needs to have a positive attitude or try to have it because your workers hope the best attitude of you to manage the job and that can show respect of your person.

Second example, another reason that why I agree with this statement is because all people desserve positive attitude like, if you are walking at the park and you say ""hi"" or ""have a good day"" to other person with a positive actitude they will feel good and they would think that you are a good person . Be a person with a positive attitude can be successful for yourself or for your family for example, if one of the family members has a bad day and they see you, his mood can change because of your positive attitude, you make him feel better with advices about how he needs many options to resolve his life but if you have a bad attitude you make him feel irate of you.

Third example, the last reason that why I agree with this statement is because, if you are in the school there are many teenager like you that have hard classes, but some of them have a positive attitude because they want to have a good grades, pay attention in class and try to help other students who needs it, they try to make them sucessful too, so they can have a good grades or a good future . But, if they have a bad attitude they would be have bad grades,they don't pay attention in class,they try to distract the students who want to pay attention,make argument about the class or sometimes they scape the class because they feel that they have a bad attitude and that's why it has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life.

B948405746B5,"Many students like to spend time with their friends in the school. Specially high schools are good places for students to learn and get fun with their friends. By the way some students are coming to school just for the pass their classes and work hard to graduate with high grades. I think graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years from a high school would be good for these students. Because they can go to college/university early, or work 1 year full time in a job to save money after graduated from high school or get more time to think about their career desicion.

First of all a student who graduated from high school in three years can attend to a college early. This means this student also can graduate one year early from the college and start his career early. If this student already decided to which college or university that he wants to go and what career he wants to do, this can be good for him. Also, student can understand how college classes are.

Second reason for to choose graduate early is save money for college/university. Some students who graduated from high school don't go to college/university directly. These students choose to work in a job one or two years full time to save money for college/university. This is a good option for the students who doesn't have money to pay for college/university or who doesn't want to be dependent to his family. Some families don't have money to pay their childrens' school. In this kind of situations students choose to wait one or two years instead of go to college/university directly.

Another reason to graduate early from high school is to get a extra year to make a desicion about career and college/university. Some students think it is hard to choose the right career for them in high school because when they graduateded from university their careers is going to be their whole life. Like an example sometimes students choose the job according to the classes that they liked in their high school but after they go to college/university they understand this career is not interesting more to them. According to the scientistists 35% of the college/university students decide to change their career in their freshman or sophomore year in the university. This shows that students need to think carefully while they make a decision about their careers. Also the career that a student choose effects the college/university that he wants to go because many students choose the university that gives good education and opportunites to this students about their careers that they choosed.

In conclusion I think graduate one year early from high school is a good idea for the students who wants to go to college/university early. Another reason is save money to pay college/university and final reason is to get a extra time to make a desicion about right career and school.

2B6FE734CB4E,"The one place I would like to visit in the world would be Puerto Rico. I would like to visit Puerto Rico because of the of the beautiful weather. I would like to visit Puerto Rico because of the beautiful beach's and rivers. One other reason would be because of my family.

First, the weather most of the time is hot even in the winter is hot. In the summer sometimes is ,so hot that it can reach the temperature of 100 degrees. Most of the people living in Puerto Rico are use to the hot temperature.

Next, you would see people in the beach's or at the river some people have pool but some people can't buy pools because some don't have money and some people do have money so when the weather is hot you will see most of the people at the beach's or rivers. I personally like going to the river's because the water is colder and is really refreshing when it's really hot.

Next, another reason why I pick Puerto Rico was because of there delicious foods there a lot of tropical dishes there is something call the three meat sandwich witch is made of really tender pork meat,chicken,beef then they put potato sticks and then they add the mayo and ketchup. In the holidays like Christmas puertorican people cook a hole pig and then when the pig is done cooking they cut the pig and shred it into pieces and then they eat it with rice mix with beans.

Finally, most of my family is from Puerto Rico so most of my family know's the best places to go and the type of food that we would like.

49EFF02DB815,"I am agree that some schools use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes. One of the reason that students could use the cell phones is that can search information about some homework and also they could search information for to do some proyects in class. But, at the same time affect the the students because is temptation for check facebook or other things. However, the schools needs to permit use cell phones in classroom because in cell phones we can found all the information that we want. Always thinking about how many time that student can use the cell phones for the reason that student dont waste the time use the cell phones in unnecessary.

In other case use cell phones in classroom is little bad because some students can search information for to do the test and that not is a good progress for his education. Also, affect other student to learn for the reason that some student can texting other student and proportional information about the test or some quiz. In my opinion students need to use cell phone in classroom with supervision of some teacher. The students need to have supervison with the cell phones because sometime they take picture or videos of some students ant they do photoshop for make fun of the students or make bulling.

Others reason that some schools need to permit use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes is that some students need it because they dont know very well English and they need it for use traslate. But,sometime some students just use the cell phones for traslate bad worlds in English and say it for other students. some case students use cell phones for texting with the friends and waste the time for to learn in the class other student use the cell phones for waching videos in youtube, soccer,novelas, and other videos. Also, they used the cell phones for play videogames onlyne with other peoples.

In my opinion the cell phones affect the student because they cant texting someone offside of the school and telling him information about other students and the other student could have problems. Also, the cell phones affect the students to be more lazy and the class and they dont want to work in class for to be in the cell phones.

B6620FD3348B,"""Determine never to be idle . . . It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" According to Thomas Jefferson's quote inactivity is not a way to achieve our goals, and we might be always working and striving on our goals. It is hard to think that the more effective way to be accomplish is being busy and always doing sometime. Although some people say that we accomplish more when we are inactive than when we are always doing something because we have more time to set our goals, actually we accomplish more when we are always doing something because we have more time to keep working on our goals to achieve them soon and we don't waste time that can be used to work on our goals.

Some people say that we accomplish more when we are inactive than when we are always doing something because we have more time to set our goals. The main reason why those people say that inactivity serve an important purpose is because they get more time to think what they want to do in their life and have their goals already planned. According to the New York times the people who take a moment of inactivity usually they are confident and sure about what they want to make in their life, and what goals they want to set and achieve. In addition they are more motivated and they effort more at they goals..

We accomplish more when we are always doing something because we have more time to keep working on our goals to achieve them soon. Being always active and working is the best way to achieve our goals. According to a study of the Generic_School, all the people that now is successful, they always were working on their goals and never had a moment where they thought that they had to stop and wait because the accomplishment was about to come. We always have to be working, our goals never will come easily. While we keep working on our goals, they will came to us soon.

We accomplish more when we are always doing something because we don't waste time that can be used to work on our goals. Sometimes when we are working hard on our goals, there's a time where we think that we have to stop and rest, but we shouldn't do that because that would be a waste of time that would be used to keep working. The right person to say that is my dad, when he was a teenager and already graduated, he wanted to become an Industrial Engineer, but he didn't want to go collage after he graduated. He wanted to wait and be inactive at least one year before to enter in collage, but that was a big mistake because at that time he didn't get a job, so he used a part of the money that he would have used in collage. Now he is not a Industrial Engineer, he never achieved his goal because he wasted the time that he could use to achieve his goal.

Though some people say that inactivity is more effective than activity to be accomplish because is a better way to set our goals, activity is the best way to be accomplish because we can achieve our goals more soon and we don't waste useful time. In conclusion, as you can see inactivity will not be the best way because the reality is that if we can done our goals and get a lot of wonderful things just being always active.

901DD3AC6032,"Here's a question to you all, do you think that working in a group is better then working alone, if you wonder which I prefer it's simple, I say that working alone in modern age is better than a group.

Now I'm going to put out three claims I have working alone; with friends, modern students, and a big distraction.

The first is friends. If you have friends (which I believe everyone does.) then you will always notice that you want to be with your friends and not with random students you don't know about and have a weird relationship (as close friend not a different level.) and hate each other, but of course friends talk about whatever they talk about also having more than one friend means it's going a big loud party getting distracted and that's how students don't get their work done.

Second modern students, this is for teachers mostly, teacher's know how students today are like; there noisy, not mature, always fighting both yelling and physically, as well as boys pants or jeans are sagging, and girls having tight clothes to show skin. Now the two I mention are noisy and fighting, modern students get offended easily which results in fighting physically, before they start fighting they always talk a lot and its nothing to do with work and make a lot of noises distract others from working.

And third but no least a big distraction. Yet again students working so hard but are distracted by so many noises to be dragged along in it, friends are and will always be similar to siblings, ""how?"" you many ask all great teacher, well siblings do one that I mentioned in this paragraph ""a big whopping distraction"" if your female teacher and have kids than you what i'm talking about however males don't have all problems females have but think one thing that you so hard and fail or forgot whatever you were doing all because of your kids or siblings took that away from you and thats how students are like and I really don't have explain anything about students since their modern and child like.

I will say in a group seems like good idea, you know the more brains the more solutions to have, although it's a good idea at less in the past or better minds but this is the modern ages were people always on their cell phones, always fighting, and barely talking about their future, but being alone is better since you won't a distraction around, confident in your work with out people judging, and you won't be crowded.

And now for my conclusion. If you know what I have been talking about this entire time then you know being alone for is better since they can just improve on their own and not always rely on others, you get it know, it's your choice to choose which one, alone or a group I just hope you know your doing teach.",Male,9,Hispanic/Latino,429,514,499,14,7,71.28571429,68.55396132,40.46692607,208,514,Independent,Economically disadvantaged,Working with a group or alone,3.5,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,"here's a question to you all, do you think that working in a group is better then working alone, if you wonder which i prefer it's simple, i say that working alone in modern age is better than a group. now i'm going to put out three claims i have working alone with friends, modern students, and a big distraction. the first is friends. if you have friends which i believe everyone does. then you will always notice that you want to be with your friends and not with random students you don't know about and have a weird relationship as close friend not a different level. and hate each other, but of course friends talk about whatever they talk about also having more than one friend means it's going a big loud party getting distracted and that's how students don't get their work done. second modern students, this is for teachers mostly, teacher's know how students today are like there noisy, not mature, always fighting both yelling and physically, as well as boys pants or jeans are sagging, and girls having tight clothes to show skin. now the two i mention are noisy and fighting, modern students get offended easily which results in fighting physically, before they start fighting they always talk a lot and its nothing to do with work and make a lot of noises distract others from working. and third but no least a big distraction. yet again students working so hard but are distracted by so many noises to be dragged along in it, friends are and will always be similar to siblings, ""how?"" you many ask all great teacher, well siblings do one that i mentioned in this paragraph ""a big whopping distraction"" if your female teacher and have kids than you what i'm talking about however males don't have all problems females have but think one thing that you so hard and fail or forgot whatever you were doing all because of your kids or siblings took that away from you and thats how students are like and i really don't have explain anything about students since their modern and child like. i will say in a group seems like good idea, you know the more brains the more solutions to have, although it's a good idea at less in the past or better minds but this is the modern ages were people always on their cell phones, always fighting, and barely talking about their future, but being alone is better since you won't a distraction around, confident in your work with out people judging, and you won't be crowded. and now for my conclusion. if you know what i have been talking about this entire time then you know being alone for is better since they can just improve on their own and not always rely on others, you get it know, it's your choice to choose which one, alone or a group i just hope you know your doing teach.",5

Today in the actuality is easier to take classes or courses, online or video conference, because the system of education is always trying to improve them self as everything in the world. The internet is our big source that we need everywhere and in different circumstances and the technology is a big advance that has a lot of benefits for us, like make our life easier.

My point of view about the student attending classes from home. First, most of the students in High School are teenagers, if they are in their homes taking classes it make the possibility that they do not socialite with the people and they can not find a firm personality. Second, the students could have problems in their vision in cause of the long time looking a monitor, laptop, tablet, Etc. Third, some of the students are beneficiary of their free lunches in school, so, if they are in home it will be more expensive for the parent to pay extra food. To conclude, those were some of my points of views or disagrees about attend to school from home.

This is a list about the agrees and it could be a benefit in my opinion:

Do not have to spend gas going to school.

Do not spend in different clothes everyday.

The government, do not have to pay a lot of teachers, so maybe taxes can get lower.

We can use a different schedule to see classes, and the other time to work.

The students do not have to socialize with the teacher, so, no disagrees and problems between the student and the teacher.

This ideas was basically what i think about attend classes from home, maybe it could be better or maybe no, the mostly reason i think is fine to attend school from home is, if you have a disability or sickness that don't let you go to school.

04B3A4DD9460,"I agree that talking to guidence is a good idea because guidence can help people on what is good or bad things to do in life. same people can even talk to guidence about thier problems and tell them what can be best can be a good solution for thier problems or for what they are passing throw in life too, However not that many people like to talk to guidence about thier problems people prefer to stay silence about their issues.

Eventhough some may say that people should not talk to guidence because guidence does not help in anything. guidance is the best resorce person to go to because they help you to stay focoues in problems you go throw in life.

Let say for example if you need help in school problems with family's or someone dies that was really close to you guidance could help you with depresion problems, familiy problems they are councelers but just few changes,

guidance can help you with paper work that you don't understand and fill in the paper work. Guidance is a good idea because guidence can help people on many stuff and find sulution of it one way to another. Guidance is the act of process of guiding, it also has counseling such as that provided for students about vocational and eduaction matters, Any of variovs processes of guiding a vericle by means of biltin equipment.

Guidance is someone who guides to the right way, or someone to look up too. gauidance is a good solution to problems and festration when a person does not have no one to talk to and they could have trust on guidance. where could people find guidance well guidance are in school or out of school too. Guidance help kids with school and fouces more on school and talk to parents, on how to maintan a kid focues in school and home.

Guidance helps kids to love and keep parents involved with them more and show them how to pertect thier kids.

179E8E1AF20C,"Agree with both but the still bad too. Think to working with a group is more beneficial. Because when people work together. can help each and to know many thing. when someone doesn't understand anything But if cowork knows he or she can help that persone to understand what didn't know. For examples work in the Wandy story when someone is new amployment and doesn't know anything about work, the can call someone who can help you and make understand what is going on in the job. And to show what job the suit that person.

Some people thing work alone is beneficial yes. Agree because in the world the's some people the very smart. The can do something in the on idea without ask somebody. For example Mr. Bill Gate nobody tell or teacher him how to creator compture. But he thing himeself. But for work alone is very bored because nobody is there can ask for help if something is bother. And when the needed to understand can take longtime for understand.

Work in the group still good because the can make funny for each other the help to found good ideas and the can make a lot of thing, but there's some people in the work group who can gossip the other people because when work in the group, people need to have big heart and be strong for what the talk about person. That why some peopl love to work alone because the don't need trouble. For example, work in Generic_City, the is many people work in the Generic_City the from different countries, the speak different language, and the have different culture in the job when someone talk something in different language the don't understand people thing the talk about someone. Because the don't understant that language.

Work in group is depend for person who want or feel to work in the group. To work in the group is help because the work goes faster when the give someone who have experience for work. And when the work in the group people need to have dedication for work and to be strong. When supervise want the work to do fast is good for people who work in the group. But when the person work alone sometime is good and sometime is bad cause when manager needed that work to be done fast, maybe can make some mistake because need to do quickly to finish that job.

Both idea stiil good. Because in the work persone need benefits what is support to do. Do what make other feel good and don't do what make other feel confuse because the want to learned, and people need to be good at work and help each other and everybone the can reached they're goals. And for someone who work alone still good when don't need someone or something to bother, the wanted to focus in that work until the work done that still good idea.

F9111CF0A009,"one topic that is that is frequently debate today is'' four-day school week.'' Some people think is better for students, so they can have three days free to do their homework and have a par time job. I believe that students don't need four-day school and extend the school day two hours, because some students can't work after school or do our homework, students can't have time for our families in afternoon. and students can't have three days off and after come and they will not remember what they learn last class.

one reason why is students can't work after school or do their homework because students will come tire after ten hours on school. student will come late and they will come just to have a dinner and sleep. students will come so late that they will not be able to do their homework on time do to no time for them. students need five day to do what they normally do they will have time for homework, have a dinner, and sleep well everyday. and the next they they can come ready to learn more and enjoy the school hours.

another reason why is that students will not have time for their families. students having ten hours in the school come tires and they don't want to talk not event with their families. Some students come straight to the bed and their families don't have time to talk to them or give an advice. Some families have the tradition to go out like five or six at clock but students will not be able to go out with families and friends. that's why students need the normal days to study they have a routine that they follow.

The final reason why is that students can't take three days off and after come they will not remember what they learn last class. Some teachers choose that Monday is a really good day to start with a test or quiz students will not remember what they learn after three days with out study. Sometimes students are learning a topic really important and they understand but when they come after three days off they will not remember anything. If students will have three days off they will work these days and when they come back to school after three days of they will not be able to remember everything they will forget. students need the five days to study how suppose to be.

as you have read four-day school is not good idea because students will not have time to study do their homework and enjoy with their families.

But little so they know it can say a lot of things about a person for instants people might first look at someones smile to see if they have a good hygiene. and to see if they are clean and well organized person. First immersions say a lot like a job interview, meeting people, and a first date.

Firstly, Is a job interview. In a job Interview the most important thing to have a very good first immersion, so they would want to hire the person. For example just by the clothes someone is wearing can determine the seriousness someone has for the job. For Instants if they show up with unwashed clothes on and the most messiest shoes, and the most rudes attetude. The interviewers will think they are not really serious for the job they are applying for. Some people might think will what if they can not afford nice clothes like other people, however if they really serious about the job they will do the best the can and empress the interviewers.

Secondly, when meeting new people just by doing a simple action, someone can tell a lot about the person they are meeting. For example just by giving a person a big, tight, warm hug can say that they are very outgoing and friendly. But also by giving a mean look or comment to somone can mean that you are sometimes rude. People might say or think that some people can give warm tight hugs and be very friendly but once you can get to know them they can be very rude. However, not every one is like that their are many people that are nice when you meet them and all through out the friendship.

Lastely, when going on a first date people try their absoulute best to imperesse the other person, for instants they can try to make funny jokes to give the imperesion that they are vey funny. Another example can be politeness so they can seem polite and intersting. but many people might think what if they lie and try to pretend that they are some one else that they are not, However not every one is that crule to do that and they will proply try to act much like them who they are.

8B72978E5087,"Some schools use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes as a helpful tool for students to study, but it turn out to be a huge problem that our school deal with. Schools purpose from letting students have and use their cell phones in class is to help them understand some hard questions or to find some definitions or anything else that help them to be successful. What makes using cell phones in the classroom a great issue are using phones in a wrong way, phones can easily distract anyone not just students, and students use it for another things, for the affections that can led students to fail their classes.

Although some schools let students use their cell phone in the classroom for educational purposes, students use their phone in a bad way by cheating or copy answers. We as students want to use the easy way to find answer without even think of the consequences of what we are about to do. I know someone from my classroom who always get caught by teacher cheating on a test or cheating on something else. To solve this problem teacher must collect phones every class to avoid students from cheating and let them have it whenever the teacher give students project that need cell phone to do. Some countries in Asia do not allow students to have their cell phone in the classroom nor school and they're really successful.

Electronic devise (cell phones) made to notify the holder if someone text him by a tone or flash light, and that work with the human Brian to make us look at it as soon as someone text us. most of us as students can't control ourselves, we want to know who send it and what he send, and that make us concentrate more on our phones and lose focusing on the class. Most of the time I can can control myself to avoid looking on my cell phone when someone text me however, since I know that's someone text me, my attention goes to my phone because I'm in class thinking on who send me and what he send. I repeat, to solve this problem teachers have to collect phones from students in the beginning of every class.

Finally, students use their cell phone for another things. Almost all students open social media (Facebook, Snapchat, etc...) while they're in a middle of a lesson, other students play games, other text on their phones, or other doing anything else. The reason why students use their cell phone is because students get bored of class for whatever reason or anything else. I remembered that guy Generic_Name, he was really smart guy, and one day our teacher give us prompt to write about, he was sitting opening Facebook for the whole class time. For all teachers I repeat for the third time collect phones from the students in the beginning of every class to avoid us from wasting times and to finishing or work.

In concussion, some schools use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes, but we us students do the opposite thing.

98D8FF9E3C56,"The life is being more modern, people also need to improve themselves. That's why some schools want to offer some programs which are good for students. Some school districts offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. Most students who allow this plan must take courses during the summers or in the evenings or may not be able to take elective courses.

This plan has two positions,some people agree, but others don't think it's a good idea. Is it a good idea? It is. It is a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college or the work force one year early if the students want because they can save time, they can have new experiences, new challenges which help for their life in the future, they still can take elective courses also have vacations latter after college or work if they want.

Let's start with the first reason now. Do you agree that the time is limit? The time is the only thing you can't move back. Because of this, a lot of people, especially students are thinking how to spend time helpful. These programs will help many students save time. They can save one year in school, that also means they can reach success early one year. Many people spend summer having vacations to relax, and evenings watching TV, but the other people spend this time studying. They choose have more time after success instead of have time when they haven't had anything.

The next reason will be the reason help students the most. Most students who follow this plan will have a lot of experiences also challenges because they must have the same knowledge in shorter time than, they will have pressure, but it will grow up ourselves. They can become stronger, independent by working on own and have more information about lessons because this time is not enough for teachers can teach everything, they must research more.

The last reason refers to elective courses. Many students like these courses, but some students don't. These programs do not require to take elective courses, so some students can skip these course which they don't like or do not helpful for their career. They also take these courses after college or work if they want. They can choose also consider what is they need. Moreover, this plan don't require you skip these elective courses, you just may not be able to take these, so if you want to take courses, you can plan for this. It depends on your choice.

On the other hand, many students do not agree this plan. They think it gives stressful for them, they worry about they cannot have enough lessons. But if you think that it means you don't confide your ability also don't try for your future. Sometimes, the life needs challenges to grow up and it will be interesting. To enter college or the work, all we need are knowledge or skill, not how long we took them. You can choose your way, success will come soon or later depends on you.

Conclusion, we should support some schools offer these programs that allow high school students to graduate early if they can. Our life will change if we change, our success will come if we try, and it will happen early if we have a plan. After all, which one do you agree with? It is a challenge but many students can do. However, it will be fair if students can choose take or not these programs.

my mom once told me that the school is very important for our health and brain.

because it makes students smarter each day and year, even it helps our health by not doing dumb stuff. instead of making the school days short and not learn nothing, dont care about nothing ,and waste students and the teachers time. The three reasons why i think the school should add one and a half in every of school days is beacause you can study anything or work you have to owe in on one and a half hour left of school. And play sport in the last hour during school. I think the reason why the schools' want to add more school hours is to help us more for our future and SOL qnd for the future is for our jobs and for the SOL is if you understand the things the teacher tought us duri ng the schools' days. second i think they reason why the school dont want to lower the hours it is because the students dont have enough time of studying or makup work they owe to their teachers. and then they will never do it because they dont have enough time to do thier work. Some students agree with me that the school should add more hours because the students would like to help the teachers cleaning up the bathrooms, cleaning up the classrooms and, cleaning up the cafeteria even collecting the chairs and putting it upside down, moping the floor. and some outher students are not in my side because they dont like school and dont want to work and they want to do anything they want in their life and if they lower the school hours it will be a miss because the students will come but it will be crowded and make a miss and never be calm in the school days. the reason why i agree adding more school hours is awsome becasue the last hour and a half i can have free time or do the work i need to finsh for tomorrow or for any day the teacher told me and my classmates. these are my reason why i think they should add one and a half hour of school days'.

An afterschool homework club would be nice to have because they get better grades, they could study more, and they could understand the subject better

Next, they could study more. Studying more could be a benefit because better test grades, better quiz grades, etc. Also they could get ahead on their classes by doing extra homework and normal work. If you never study you could start by considering to join this club. It could be loads of fun if you make it fun.

Therefore, they could understand the subject better by getting someone to help them. Doing loads of extra work to get your grade up and understand it better. They could help each other out and could achieve their goal of getting to understand the difficult subject.

If the statement about the role that failure plays in the pursuit of success, it could help people to do better things. People can have a better future. Also people can feel more positive.

First, people can do better things. For example, my cousin Generic_Name had a soccer game at Generic_City, she and her team was talking about how they will need to play on the field, they needed to play better than the other games because the team that she was going to play against is one of the best teams that plays on that field and also her team needed to have more goals scores to keep being on the list so the can win the championship, so when they started to play they was playing like they planned it before the game and at the end of the game they won and everyone was happy because they never thought that they was going to have the chance to win that team, but they never give up.

Next, people can have a better future. For example, my parents after they got married they always wanted to have a better future for them and for all there kids they was going to have, so both of them was planning to cross the board from Mexico to the United States, so after a week they finally cross the board and they was living with my grandma, when my dad started working after a couple of months my dad bought a new house and they started to live there, then they were saving money to buy more stuffs because they was going to need to buy a lot of things like: beds, clothes, shoes, table, chairs, etc. After some years they finally got everything they needed and they had two kids and finally got to know that they will have a better future.

Last, people can feel more positive. For example, when my cousin talk to her coach about that I wanted to be in a team of soccer, the coach called me and told me that he wanted me to play soccer with his team the next weekend, but before that I told him that I was not that good at playing soccer and he told me that I will learn easier and faster if I go to practices, so when I went to my first game I was so nervous about that I was not going to play good as the other girls do, and I did not wanted them feel bad if we lose for my fault, but I kept playing and I never thought that at my first game I was going to make a goal, but overall I kept going from failure to failure and never loss my enthusiasm and that is one of the reasons that helped me feel more positive of myself.

D25F59B6DC95,"Although some people say that first impressions are impossible to change, nevertheless I think that first impressions can sometimes change because you get to know thaht person, how they act, and that can sometimes change what you think about them or they can sometimes not change.

In order to think about something about that person you have to get to know them because if you don't know them you won't know why are they being like that. You can't just think something wrong just cause of how they dress. If you get to know that person you will know what they been through.

The reason I've choose come here and applied is because; it's not a complicated job, I can learn from experience and make my parent's proud. All i want is a opportunity to show you i'm worth it,i know a lot of people say that but the difference is i'll do it, I know a lot about shoes i have my own collection so i would be a great fit in your store, all i'm asking for is a chance.

I'm available from Monday through Thursday, right after i get off of school, four to nine would be great for my schedule or five to eleven, it all depends on my school schedule every other day i have off campus 2 period it's basically a class were i can't be on school grounds for that time period which means i don't have school usually till 10 which is perfect because i usually always wake up around eight thirty to nine.

From the looks of the company,

it looks amazing no wonder why my relatives and friends keep coming here, you guys have such great quality,that's amazing because it's not expensive.

The amount you make per hour working here is a great amount in my opinion. The job's i used to work were Footlocker and Forever 21 both jobs put me in a position were i had to help people find what their looking for. I stayed at forever 21 for almost two years and worked four day's a week and i still work at Footlocker to this day and if i get this job i then i can leave Footlocker and work here.

I left Forever 21 because my parent's thought i wasn't really focusing at school an mainly at work, The main reason i left is that they never acknowledge me as a person they treated me like i'm some kind of pet and if you know me,having no respect is one thing i can't tolerate and if the disrespect is towards me that's when their's a problem. Respect me as a human not like i'm your puppet,sometimes i make a mistake but you dont' have to embarrass me in front of customers or the staff.

840D73A3804A,"Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? I believe that if we do more, then we get more things done. I say that because if you just do what you're gonna say, rather than talking about it, you can get very far in life, and you will be successful. You know why? because you're a action taker, and not just a dreamer, who just expects stuff without the hard work. You also get more noticed, and people will like to be around you, because you're more active, and you're more unique, than most people.

My first reason is that if you just put that action into movement, then you're powerful already. No one can stop you, because your mindset is on a whole new other level. People can't ketch up to you, and people will be jealous of your success. You will have haters. Hate on you, but don't let that slow you down! keep doing, and achieving and great things will come down to your way. For example:There is a saying that If someone is hating on you, then you're doing something great, if they're not hating on you, then you're not doing anything really.

My second reason is that you're a type of person willing to do anything to achieve your goals. You will let nothing in your way. You are ready to grab life by it's neck, and just yank it, cause it's yours. You gotta take over your life now. Don't wish, and wait. Start now, and don't let stuff handed to you. You gotta work for it, and just love the process. Trust me you will not regret it, if you just start making good habits for yourself. For example: doing your homework, and stop procrastinating on the stuff you need to do, or want to do, doing tasks when you don't feel like it. You will be great, and you'll thank yourself in the future.

My third reason, and final reason is you get more noticed, and people will like to be around you, because you're more active, and you're more unique, than most people. Ah, yes nobody likes a person that's just ""normal"". I find that quite lame, and boring. They would like a person that is quite different, and not the same as everybody else you know. For example: You wouldn't want to meet the same people every time now would you? of course not. You would want to meet different people, and find new things, and also most importantly learn new stuff by different people. You would want people with different personalities, not the same ones, as that would be boring. You are more active, than just sitting down. You are taking your chances, and not blowing it. You are taking advantage of life, than just wasting it. Nobody wants to hang out, or deal with someone that is just negative all day, or a loser. They would want to hang with someone that is quite active, respectful, and successful.

My conclusion: Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? I believe that if we do more, then we get more things done. I say that because if you just do what you're going to say, rather than talking about it, you can get very far in life, and you will be successful.

I am interesting to became a professional mechanic because mechanics work with big machines and they know how to use them correctly. They know if something is wrong with your car, but most important is that they know each part of a car. I remember when I was 7 years old and I always go to help my dad because he is a mechanic, so he teach me almost every part of a car and show me how to fix a car

Mechanics work with big machines. I would like to know how to work with all those type of machines that they use. My dreams was to become a professional mechanic because they work really hard and make sure that people's cars are safe to drive in the streets. Mechanics have a good salary. they earn 50,000 per year.

They know how to repair cars. it will be more easy to me to repair my own car or help other people. Sometimes when I was 13 years I remember that my dad spend almost one month teaching me how to fix a car or see what's wrong with a car . he teach me so many things and now I

Some people think that schools should take the control of the activities students take, because extracurricular activities take students' time and energy away which makes them have little time to study or do a homework. Other people think that students should control the activities they are taking themselves because they know better their abilities and needs. I believe that giving the decision to the student is better because students know their schedule, the activities they need and their capacity.

Most of students have their own calender that they make their schedule in and put down their chores and responsibilities for each day. According to the their schedule, they choose the activities they need. In my sophomore year my math teacher required me to take an extra math class after school on Fridays. Despite it was so hard for me to stay after school and go to the basketball practice I have every Saturday tired, I was also being late to the mosque or sometimes found no energy to go. If

I was scheduling this I would choose another day in the week to practice my math as my teacher want. Since the schools or the teachers dont know student's schedule, it will be better to give the students the chance to make their own schedule.

Additionally, each student have a dream career that they want to major in. The purpose of the extracurricular activities sometimes be practicing the major students are interested in, which I think it's more important for students to practice their career than doing a homework, because it will give them the skills and the experience they will need when they graduate and major in the field they want. If schools will be choosing the activities for students, they may choose something the students are not interested in. According to an article I read about the volunteering requirements in schools, its wrong for the students to volunteer or work on something they are not interested in, this confuse them in the future while choosing a career, and this actually what happened to my brother while he was enrolling in college. He entered undecided because he did the activities the school choosed for him which was not in his interest. that's means that schools should not choose activities for students because students knows what they need and if they dont they will asks for help.

Furthermore, people born with different skills and capacity. Students know how much activity they can take. Schools sometimes give all the students the same load while not all of students can handle the same load. The school required our English class with some after school activities, which was so much for some students and while others was success others was failing. schools should let students choose the amount of the activities they need and in case if school found that the activities is so much or so low and that is effecting the their progress in school, school can contact their parents and find a solution.

Since the purpose of the school is to teach students and give them the enough knowledge to face the society, students should learn taking their own decisions and always know what better for themselves. Schools should let students choose their own activities because they best knows their schedule or responsibilities, what they want to choose to experience in, and how much load they can handle.

21884C3DC96A,"I like to work with a group because working with people helps you benefit from a lot of ways. One way is helping each others when working in a group. when i work with my friends we help each other with things that might be hard for us to do. I sometimes don't know how to answer a question so i ask the people i am working with to help me with it. The people you work with might not know something that i might know so that's a good thing when you work in groups. I like to help my friends or my group members with any thing because thats what group work is about.

2.

When working in a group we communicate a lot and talk about everything we have to do. i like to talk when i work in a group it even helps me learn more things that i did not know about. Sometimes i don't know how to say something in English so i ask my partner to help me say it or pronounce it. When i don't know something it's hard for me to talk about it or try to help when i don't understand what they are talking about. its good for me to work in group because it helps me learn more English.

3.

working in groups helps you and your partners to do less work. When i work in a group we split the work fairly if someone does not like the part he/she have to do we will give them a different one. For me i like to do the most easy one but i do not get that all the time sometimes i have to do a hard part and sometimes i have to do a easy part. I do struggle with things sometimes because i do not speak good English but i ask my partners to help me with what ever i do not understand.

4.

One way to get to know people better is working with them and talk to them. When i work with people it shows me who the person is and what they like to do. For me i like to know people better and make them comfortable around me even if they are shy. Some people don't like working in groups because they like to work by them self which is not a bad thing. Talking to people is one of my favorite things to do especially if i know the person more.

It would be great for me to work in a group because it benefits me with a lot of things in a lot of ways. one thing is to get help from others and help others.

0BEB8F7F5A64,"First impression are very important when you first meet someone. Many people say first impressions are almost impossible to change, but i strongly disagree with that. Majority of the time when we meet someone we already think of them in a certain way, but our judgment could always be wrong. Thats why i believe first impressions could always change.

I believe that first impressions can change the way people think of you. Sometimes people can be irritable or just in a really bad mood because something is occurring in their lives, but in reality that's not how they really are. One reason first impressions can be wrong, is because maybe they didn't get enough sleep at night, and they have to get up early to go to work, or school in the morning. For example, i am not much of a morning person, so when i wake up in the mornings i can be rude, and people might not want to talk to me, but if you see me later in the afternoon i will be smiling, and laughing. Another reason first impressions could be wrong, is because they might not feel comfortable with the people who they are surrounded by, and be very shy, but once you start talking to them they change. For example, my best friend and i used to hate each other. I used to think she was annoying, and rude, and i am guessing she thought the same for me. One day we both started to talk to each other, and i found out we have many things in common, and that we are like the same people. That same day we became the best of friends, now we are basically like sisters. This is why i think that first impressions can always change.

A3A0AB366927,"Working idenpendently is harder than working as a group, but it's also better to learn things. Etheir working as a group or not you are still getting work done, and learning as you go. When I state that you can ""learn"" it means that you can find out things especially as a group where everyone has they're own ideas and facts about topics. Some people just take working as a group as an advantage to just copy and get answers just to get things done. Copying others does not help you learn anything other then getting your work completed.

I think it is better working alone beacuse it would be better for me to learn. Yes, i'd probably take a long time getting it done just because I would be taking my time finding little details. Some people choose not to work independently but I do. One reason why I think it is better to work alone is because of the fact that after your done you'll feel relieved and happy. If you did what you had to do alone without anybodys help besides the person who gave you the assignment, or job whatever than you done a good job just by doing your work independently.

Working as a group isn't bad I just suggest it should be better for students or anyone to work idependently also to learn what their doing instead of just getting it done when you can learn and get it done. Some people end up just copying off someone else to get stuff done. Others they actually do it and share with others who actually also have stuff done to share. Not everyone copies, nor cheats just alot of people such as students take working as a group an advantage to copy. Working together as a group can be much more easier than alone but still working independently is much more helpful for your learning benifits.

Anyone who is not used to doing independent work gets a little kick on working alone because their so used to working as a group. It helps people push them selves on finding more details, facts, and clues for what they need. If you do struggle of course you can obvisouly ask a teacher or anyone for a hand in help because you could be stuck on something. You can focus more on your work while your alone because if your in a group working it gets you distracted. If you hear other students or people talking to you, and the rest of the group giving each other ideas while your focued to find your own ideas gets you to unfocused.

Somebody elses ideas in the group could be wrong, and when you write them and use those ideas you could be wrong as well. People usually rely on others to get answers which is not right. Also it's hard for others to communicate with others as a group which it also makes it better for anyone to work alone. You could do things your own way while working independently.
