    "student_essay": "as you know I moved to Germany 11 years ago. At that time I didn't \nknow that I could stay here because the purpose of my move was \nthe au-pair programme. Although moving abroad has shaped my \npersonal growth so much! \nMy first host family was very kind at first, but then they started to \nexploit me. Knowing my rights helped me with this problem. After \nseveral strange incidents I decided to change my host family. I am \nso glad I did this step and overcame it. I learned so much from \nthis situation, especially that I shouldn't let myself be exploited \nand that changes lead to a better life. \nI also learned to be more self-sufficient. It used to get help from \nother people, for example when I was looking for information o \nhow to apply for university. My host father helped me a lot in the \nbeginnings until he said now I had to do it by myself. It was hard \nespecially finding information in another language but diligent \nwork paid off. Since then I always look for information by myself. \nOnly when can't find the right information do I ask other people. \nBecause other people have their own problems and their own \nlives, you shouldn't overload them.",
