    "student_essay": "Nowadays everyone talks about travelling more than ever before. Whether you are watching Tiktok or your colleague or friend is telling you about their last trip. So it is more common for people to travel than not.There could be many reasons why.First of all, these days it is much easier to travel because of a lot of information about destinations.There are ready itineraries or even tours for almost every country in the world, which include the most popular or must-see sights. You can also easily find flights without booking separately. Taking out travel insurance makes travelling safer and cancelation/postpone options gives your more flexibility. Therefore everything is given, all you have to do is pay.Secondly, travelling has become more affordable now due to low cost airlines and hostel / couchsurfing options. Especially backpacker can benefit from this possibility. Additionally as well as long-haul as short-haul flights are cheaper than 40 years ago.The next reason is social media. We see more pictures and videos of beautiful scenery around the world and it inspires us to travel there and see it for ourselves. We get it on every platform: instagram, tiktok, Youtube etc. so there is almost no chance to stay indifferent.Another reason is that we can benefit from travelling. Not only makes it us happy, but it also broadens our horizons. We learn about other culture, cuisine and people. Travel teaches us appreciation about own country and gives new ideas for personal or cultural growth.We can also practice language that we learn and just collect memories.These are some of the reasons why travelling is becoming so popular, but in the end there are many more.",
